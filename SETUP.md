You can use any QR code generator. Create codes pointing to:

**Character Selection QR Codes:**
- Psychic: `https://your-domain.com/character/psychic.html`
- Baker: `https://your-domain.com/character/baker.html`
- (etc. for each character)

**Vision QR Codes (place around venue):**
- Alice: `https://your-domain.com/vision/alice.html`
- Cordelia: `https://your-domain.com/vision/cordelia.html`
- Sebastian: `https://your-domain.com/vision/sebastian.html`

### Recommended QR Generators

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Character not persisting after page reload
**Solution**: Check browser privacy settings. If in private/incognito mode, localStorage may be restricted.

### Issue: Vision counter not incrementing
**Solution**: Make sure you're using the same browser/device. Each device has separate localStorage.

### Issue: CSS styling not showing
**Solution**: Check file paths. Ensure you're running through a server (not `file://`).

### Issue: QR code links not working
**Solution**: Use full URLs with domain, not relative paths. Test links manually first.

### Issue: Mobile responsiveness issues
**Solution**: 
- Test in multiple browsers
- Check DevTools device emulation (F12 ‚Üí Device Toolbar)
- Verify meta viewport tag is present
