      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>Pedantic, detail-oriented record-keeper obsessed with proper documentation and estate management. You know where all the records are, though you haven't always read them thoroughly. Usually found in the Fiduciary's Office, surrounded by files and ledgers.</p>
      <p><strong>Your Secret Hobby:</strong> You collect poisonous spiders and snakes. You're an expert in toxicology, though few people know this about you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Special Abilities</h2>
      <p><strong>Estate Records Expert:</strong> When you scan legal or financial documents, you see detailed information others miss. You can interpret contracts, property records, and follow money trails.</p>
      <p><strong>Toxicology Knowledge:</strong> Your secret hobby gives you expertise in poisons. You can identify toxic substances, understand symptoms, and determine methods of poisoning.</p>
      <p><strong>Information Gatekeeper:</strong> You control access to official records. You can choose when to share information with others.</p>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You work for a generational wealth management firm that has managed the estates of the <strong>Montrose, Crane, and Whitmore families</strong> for decades. These properties have been a professional frustration—the haunted mansion has been an eyesore and wasted asset for generations.</p>
      <p>While researching the Montrose estate, you traced the lineage to find the Heiress and contacted her about the unclaimed property. You hoped she'd take possession and finally do something with it.</p>
      <p>During your research, you discovered records about the <strong>Crane family name change</strong>—they became the Sinclairs in the 1960s, apparently for political reasons. You found a box of old papers connecting Dr. Thaddeus Crane to a brother named <strong>Sebastian Crane.</strong> You've never heard of Sebastian Crane, and you've been managing the estates for years! You sent this box to Dr. Sinclair, curious about their reaction.</p>
      <p>Now you've noticed some <strong>disturbing inconsistencies in death records from 1925,</strong> and you're determined to finally understand what happened. You've heard rumors about the ghosts haunting the mansion, and you can't shake off a strange feeling.</p>

        <li>Discover who paid the Mortician. Follow the money—who bribed the Mortician to cover something up in 1925?</li>

        <li>Who was Sebastian Crane? The records are incomplete and mysterious—as if someone tried to erase him from existence completely.</li>

        <li>Read everything thoroughly or only what's necessary for your job</li>
        <li>Reveal information freely or strategically withhold it</li>
        <li>Collaborate with others or investigate independently</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The choice is yours:</strong> Will you be the helpful guide or the secretive gatekeeper?</p>
