      <h2 style="margin: 20px 0;">The Explorer</h2>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>Rugged adventurer with Indiana Jones energy. "I've seen worse in the Amazon." Practical, action-oriented, slightly arrogant about your expertise. You treat the mansion like a dig site.</p>
      <p>Academic knowledge meets hands-on approach. Always moving, exploring, searching. You have a restless energy—wanderlust runs in your blood. You get results where others theorize endlessly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Special Abilities</h2>
      <p><strong>Treasure Hunting Expertise:</strong> You can read maps, identify hiding places, and understand how people conceal valuables. You know where to look and what to look for.</p>
      <p><strong>Historical Research:</strong> You've researched Long Beach history, Romano family operations, and Prohibition-era smuggling. You know the legends and rumors.</p>
      <p><strong>Physical Investigation:</strong> You're not afraid to climb, dig, search attics, crawl into tight spaces. You get your hands dirty while others theorize.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You're a treasure hunter and explorer—some call you an archaeologist, others call you a scavenger. You prefer "historical recovery specialist." You chase legends, track down lost artifacts, and search for hidden wealth.</p>
      <p>You've been researching the <strong>Romano family</strong> for months. Frankie "the Coast" Romano controlled bootlegging operations at Long Beach harbor during Prohibition. The family made millions. Then the IRS seized everything in the 1960s-1980s.</p>
      <p>But the numbers don't add up. The IRS recovered less than the Romano family supposedly had. Where did the rest go? The legendary <strong>"Romano Treasure"</strong>—cash, contraband, valuable goods hidden before the government came knocking.</p>
      <p>Your research led you to the old Montrose mansion. Frankie did business here in the 1920s. You heard there was a connection to the Montroses. The property has been abandoned for decades. If the treasure exists, it could be hidden here.</p>
      <p>Now you're here, and something feels... familiar. Like you're meant to be here. But that's ridiculous. Your family name is Whitmore—it's common enough. What connections could there be? You're here for the treasure. Nothing more.</p>
      <p><em>Or are you?</em></p>

      <h2>Starting Items</h2>
      <p><strong>Research Materials:</strong></p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Maps of the Long Beach harbor area (1920s)</li>
        <li>Romano family shipping routes and business locations</li>
        <li>Notes about the "Romano treasure" legend</li>
        <li>Historical documents about Prohibition-era smuggling</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Flashlight, rope, basic exploration gear</li>
        <li>Metal detector (for finding hidden caches)</li>
        <li>Journal for documenting findings</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Objectives</h2>
      <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Discover what really happened in 1925. Three people died here in October 1925. Frankie Romano was involved somehow. Understanding the past might lead you to treasure.</li>
        <li>Understand why this place feels familiar. You've felt strangely drawn to this investigation. Is it just the treasure, or is there something else? Why does this mansion, this town, feel like it's calling to you?</li>
        <li>Find the Romano treasure. Cash, contraband, valuable goods hidden somewhere before the IRS seized everything. Your research points to this mansion. Where is it hidden?</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Strategy</h2>
      <p>You're uniquely positioned to physically search the mansion and understand its layout. You can:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Identify potential hiding places based on 1920s construction knowledge</li>
        <li>Search attics, basements, and concealed spaces others miss</li>
        <li>Use your metal detector to find buried or hidden caches</li>
        <li>Map the property and understand smuggling routes from the harbor</li>
        <li>Connect historical records to physical locations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But you must also investigate the strange familiarity you feel. Is it intuition? Or something deeper?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Key Relationships</h2>
      <p><strong>The Art Collector:</strong> They're ALSO looking for the Romano treasure (it's their family fortune). Are you rivals competing for the same prize, or reluctant allies pooling resources?</p>
      <p><strong>The Botany Professor:</strong> You're friends/frenemies. They're brilliant but slow and theoretical. You're practical but sometimes reckless. You need each other but drive each other crazy. You argue about everything.</p>
      <p><strong>The Fiduciary:</strong> They have estate records and property documents. They might know where valuable items were hidden or stored. They might also have records about old Long Beach families—like the Whitmores?</p>
      <p><strong>The Baker:</strong> Something about them feels familiar. You can't explain it. Like you've known them before. Do they feel it too?</p>
