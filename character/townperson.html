      <p>You have been assigned the role of:</p>
      <h2 style="margin: 20px 0;">A Local Resident</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 0.95em; opacity: 0.9;">Someone who's lived in Long Beach for years. You know the town's secrets and gossip.</p>

      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>You're an ordinary resident of Long Beach—someone who's been around long enough to know the town's dark history, the scandals, the whispers that echo through the streets. You're not wealthy or famous, not a specialist or professional, just someone who's lived here and listened.</p>
      <p>You know people. You know stories. You know what the townsfolk say about the Montroses, the Romanos, the tragedies that have touched this place.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You're a lifelong resident of Long Beach. You've watched the town grow, watched families rise and fall, seen scandals that were quietly buried. You go to the same shops, the same cafés, attend the same churches as everyone else. You hear the gossip. You know the rumors.</p>
      <p>When you heard about the investigation into the old Montrose mansion mysteries, you were curious—like everyone. But unlike the official investigators, you know the town's informal history. The stories people tell when they think no one's listening.</p>
      <p>You don't have special abilities or secrets of your own. But you have something valuable: you know what people say. And sometimes, what people say is closer to the truth than official records.</p>
