      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>Flamboyant spiritualist with dramatic flair. You make grand proclamations and cryptic warnings. Draped in scarves, jewelry, mystical accessories. You speak in hushed, portentous tones about "the spirits" and "the veil between worlds."</p>
      <p>Whether you're genuinely gifted or a skilled performer, even you're not always sure. But one thing is certain: you feel a powerful connection to this place, especially to one spirit in particular.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Special Abilities</h2>
      <p><strong>Spirit Communication:</strong> You can communicate with the dead—or at least, you claim you can. Whether through genuine psychic ability or cold reading, you gather information others can't access.</p>
      <p><strong>The Laveau Legacy:</strong> You're descended from Célestine Laveau, the world-famous French psychic who practiced in California during the 1920s. The family gift (or reputation) has been passed down through generations.</p>
      <p><strong>Intuitive Reading:</strong> You pick up on emotions, hidden truths, and unspoken tensions. You know when people are lying or hiding something.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>Your name is <strong>Margo Laveau,</strong> and you carry one of the most famous names in spiritualism. Your great-great-grandmother was <strong>Célestine Laveau,</strong> world-renowned French psychic who came to California during the spiritualism boom of the 1920s.</p>
      <p>In 1925, a young woman named <strong>Alice Whitmore</strong> came to Célestine seeking help. Alice had psychic abilities herself—visions, premonitions, knowledge of things she shouldn't know. She was frightened, misunderstood by doctors who called her unstable. Célestine recognized Alice's genuine gift and tried to mentor her.</p>
      <p>Then Alice died. <strong>October 7, 1925.</strong> Officially ruled an accident.</p>
      <p>But Alice's spirit reached out to Célestine immediately. She was trapped, restless, murdered. She needed help. Célestine tried to give her peace, tried to help her move on, but Alice's spirit remained bound to the place she died—the Montrose mansion.</p>
      <p>For 100 years, Alice has been waiting. Calling out to the Laveau family. Generation after generation heard her plea but couldn't break through, couldn't help her find peace.</p>
      <p>You grew up hearing about "the restless spirit in Long Beach." The unfinished business. The young woman who died trying to save her friend. Your family's failure to help her.</p>
      <p>When the Heiress contacted you about the haunted mansion, you knew immediately: this is Alice. After a century, the time is finally right. You're here to finish what Célestine started.</p>

        <li>Validate (or debunk) other investigators' theories through psychic means</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But you must also decide: are you truly gifted, or are you just very good at reading people and situations?</p>

      <p><strong>The Clockmaker:</strong> They believe in mystical timing and cosmic significance. Finally, someone who doesn't dismiss everything as coincidence! You appreciate their openness to the unseen.</p>
      <p><strong>The Influencer:</strong> They think you're either delusional or a con artist. They keep mentioning "the God Helmet" and brain chemistry. Let them be skeptical—Alice's spirit is real whether they believe or not.</p>
