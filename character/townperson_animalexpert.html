      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>You're an eccentric soul with an unshakeable connection to the animal world. Flamboyant, unpredictable, and utterly confident in your unique perspective. While others see clues in documents and crime scenes, you see them in animal behavior, in the presence or absence of creatures, in the subtle signs nature leaves behind.</p>
      <p>People think you're strange. You don't mind. You know things they don't know. The animals tell you. And when you put your mind to it, you're sharper than any so-called expert. The three deaths at Montrose mansion? Something was wrong. The animals knew it then. They still know it now.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Special Abilities</h2>
      <p><strong>Animal Communication:</strong> You have an uncanny ability to read animal behavior and understand what animals are trying to tell you. Birds, dogs, insects—they all communicate in their own language, and you speak it fluently.</p>
      <p><strong>Natural Observation:</strong> Your keen eye for animal behavior translates into noticing details in environments others overlook. Disturbed earth, missing wildlife, unusual animal activity patterns—these tell stories.</p>
      <p><strong>Eccentric Genius:</strong> Your unconventional thinking leads to creative solutions and unexpected connections. You see patterns others miss because you think completely differently.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You've always been different. While other children played with toys, you bonded with creatures. As you grew older, your gift—for that's what it is—became undeniable. You understand animals in ways that seem impossible to other people. You've tracked missing people through the woods using nothing but animal signs. You've identified poisonings by observing insect and bird behavior around contaminated areas.</p>
      <p>When the Montrose mansion deaths occurred, you were there—not at the mansion itself, but in the surrounding woods and gardens. You noticed that the birds had abandoned the area. All of them, gone. The mice avoided certain paths. The very creatures that should have been present were absent or acting strangely.</p>
      <p>You've been trying to tell people this for years. Nobody listened. Now, with a proper investigation underway, maybe they finally will.</p>

      <h2>Notes for Play</h2>
      <p>You communicate with animals in ways that seem magical but are rooted in careful observation and deep understanding. When you interact with the natural world, you're not guessing—you're reading signs that are absolutely clear to someone with your gifts.</p>
      <p>Your strength is your ability to think outside the box and notice what everyone else has trained themselves to ignore. Sometimes the most important clues are the ones hidden in plain sight—or rather, hidden in the behavior of birds, the absence of insects, or the path a frightened animal won't cross.</p>
