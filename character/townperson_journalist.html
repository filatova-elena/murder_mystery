      <h2 style="margin: 20px 0;">Townperson Journalist</h2>

      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>You're a reporter with an instinct for the story beneath the story. Ambitious, perceptive, and driven by the need to uncover hidden truths. You've interviewed everyone worth talking to in this town, and you know which official statements don't add up.</p>
      <p>When the Montrose mansion deaths were officially closed, something inside you rebelled. Three deaths, three convenient explanations, case closed. You knew there was more. And now, with civilians invited to investigate, you see your chance to break the real story wide open.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Special Abilities</h2>
      <p><strong>Interviewing Mastery:</strong> You know how to ask questions that get people to reveal things they didn't intend to. You can read people, spot nervous tics, catch verbal slip-ups. Everyone has a story—you just know how to find it.</p>
      <p><strong>Research Networks:</strong> Years as a journalist have given you sources throughout town and beyond. You can dig up background information, track rumors, find old newspaper archives, and connect dots others miss.</p>
      <p><strong>Narrative Analysis:</strong> You understand how stories work. You can identify when the official narrative is incomplete, when someone is crafting a story rather than telling the truth, where the holes are in public accounts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You've been covering local stories for years—murders, scandals, mysteries that captivate the town. You've built a reputation for getting to the truth, for being fair but relentless, for never settling for the easy explanation.</p>
      <p>The deaths at the Montrose mansion in October 1925 felt incomplete to you. Three people dead. Three different circumstances. Three cases closed quickly. Too quickly. You wanted to investigate further at the time, but the official investigations were shut down fast and hard.</p>
      <p>Now, decades later, with a proper investigation being launched, you're determined to finally break the story you've been sitting on. This could be the biggest piece of your career—if you can prove what really happened.</p>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Notes for Play</h2>
      <p>You have no supernatural abilities. You're a wordsmith and people-reader. Your power lies in your ability to ask the right questions, connect disparate pieces of information, and understand human motivation.</p>
      <p>Remember: everyone is a story. Your job is to find out what story each person is telling themselves, and then find out what the truth actually is.</p>
