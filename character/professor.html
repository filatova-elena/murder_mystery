      <h2 style="margin: 20px 0;">The Botany Professor</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 0.95em; opacity: 0.9;">Distracted genius obsessed with deadly plants. Your ancestor's secrets are tangled in the 1925 deaths.</p>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>Distracted, absent-minded professor. Socially oblivious genius. You forget you're discussing real deaths and go off on tangents about plants and their properties. Especially curious about plant-derived poisons.</p>
      <p>You get inappropriately excited about deadly plants: "Oh how FASCINATING to use that particular alkaloid!" Then you remember people actually died and try to look somber. Brilliant but scattered.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Special Abilities</h2>
      <p><strong>Plant Identification:</strong> You can identify plants, their properties, toxicity levels, and preparation methods. You're an expert in botanical poisons and medicinal plants.</p>
      <p><strong>Historical Botanical Knowledge:</strong> You understand how plants were used in the 1920s—medicinally, recreationally, and criminally. You know what was available and how to obtain it.</p>
      <p><strong>Family Records:</strong> Your ancestor Professor Edmund Hartley was a botanical expert who consulted on "special projects" in the 1920s. You have his consultation notes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You're a botany professor, descended from <strong>Professor Edmund Hartley</strong> who ran a botanical garden and consultation service in 1920s Long Beach. You followed in his footsteps—plant toxicology, medicinal botany, historical uses of plants.</p>
      <p>Going through old family papers, you found Edmund's consultation records from 1925. A "pharmaceutical professional" (anonymous) came to him asking about:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li>Digitalis purpurea (Foxglove)—extraction methods, dosing</li>
        <li>Damiana, Valerian, Mandrake—sourcing and preparation</li>
        <li>How to mask bitter flavors in medicinal preparations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The notes also contain consultation records with <strong>Harbor Import & Trading Co.</strong> The specifics raise your suspicions about what exactly this company was and what your ancestor was involved in.</p>
      <p>You've been obsessed with this mystery ever since. When you heard about the investigation at the Montrose mansion, you had to come. You have a feeling it's all connected.</p>

      <h2>Starting Items</h2>
      <p><strong>Family Records:</strong></p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">

      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Objectives</h2>
      <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Determine if your ancestor was involved in the murders. The notes mention poisonous plants. Was Edmund somehow involved in the 1925 deaths?</li>
        <li>Identify what poison was used. At least one victim was poisoned. Discover the exact poison formula and its effects.</li>
        <li>Determine what Harbor Import & Trading Co. was. Edmund's records mention it as a supplier with unusual entries. What was the company really doing?</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Strategy</h2>
      <p>You're uniquely positioned to understand the botanical and toxicological aspects of this mystery. You can:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Identify which plants were used as poison</li>
        <li>Understand extraction methods and dosing</li>
        <li>Determine how poisons might have been administered</li>
        <li>Trace supply chains from historical records</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But you must also grapple with the possibility that your ancestor Edmund was complicit in something sinister. <strong>How complicit was he?</strong></p>

      <h2>Your Advantages</h2>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>You're an expert in plant identification and botanical poisons</li>
        <li>You understand toxicity levels and preparation methods</li>
        <li>You have Edmund Hartley's consultation notes from 1925</li>
        <li>You know how plants were sourced and used in the 1920s</li>
        <li>You can identify mysterious plant references in other documents</li>
        <li>You brought live specimens for reference and demonstration</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Relationships</h2>
      <p><strong>The Explorer:</strong> You're friends/frenemies. They're brilliant but slow and theoretical. You're practical but sometimes reckless. You need each other but drive each other crazy. You argue about everything.</p>
      <p><strong>The Town Doctor:</strong> They have medical expertise and can interpret pharmaceutical formulas. Work together to understand what the poison would actually do to a body.</p>
      <p><strong>The Mortician:</strong> They have records of symptoms and causes of death. Your botanical knowledge combined with their death investigation skills could reveal the truth.</p>
      <p><strong>The Art Collector:</strong> The Romano family imported exotic botanicals. Their shipping records might show where the poison plants came from.</p>
