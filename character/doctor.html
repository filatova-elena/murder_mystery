    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>Your family name is <strong>Sinclair,</strong> but it wasn't always. You eventually discovered that your family changed their name in the 1960s for political reasons—your ancestors were the <strong>Crane family</strong> of Long Beach.</p>
      <p>You knew you descended from <strong>Dr. Thaddeus Crane,</strong> a respectable town doctor from the 1920s. That's ALL you knew—the family buried everything else.</p>
      <p>Recently, you received a mysterious box from the Fiduciary containing old estate papers. Inside, you discover something shocking: <strong>Dr. Thaddeus Crane had a brother you've never heard about!</strong></p>
      <p>As you pursue the information in the box, you wonder about your family's dark past. You're also left to grapple with difficult questions: Why now? What does the Fiduciary know? What game are they playing?</p>
