    <h1>The Detective</h1>

      <p>You have been assigned the role of:</p>
      <h2 style="margin: 20px 0;">Townperson Detective</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 0.95em; opacity: 0.9;">Sharp-eyed investigator. Skeptical of official stories. Always asks the right questions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>You're the kind of person who notices details others miss. A fedora-wearing skeptic who trusts evidence over authority. Years of investigating small-town mysteries have made you sharp, cautious, and quietly relentless.</p>
      <p>You don't believe in coincidences. You don't trust easy answers. And you're convinced that the official story about the deaths at the Montrose mansion doesn't add up. When you heard about the investigation, you saw an opportunity to uncover the truth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Special Abilities</h2>
      <p><strong>Keen Eye for Detail:</strong> You notice things others overlook—contradictions, inconsistencies, tiny details that don't fit the narrative. Crime scene analysis is second nature to you.</p>
      <p><strong>Investigative Network:</strong> Years of investigation have given you connections throughout town. You can find information, trace leads, and access records others can't reach.</p>
      <p><strong>Skeptical Analysis:</strong> You're trained to see through lies and spin. Official statements don't fool you. You can identify when someone is being evasive or when a story has holes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You've spent years as a small-town investigator—not quite a cop, not quite a private detective, but someone the locals call when things don't add up. You've built a reputation for being thorough, relentless, and immune to pressure.</p>
      <p>The three deaths at the Montrose mansion in October 1925—ruled as accidents, suicides, poisonings—struck you as suspiciously convenient. Three deaths, three different circumstances, all resolved quickly and neatly. Too neat.</p>
      <p>When the call came for civilians to help investigate, you volunteered immediately. This is your chance to dig into a case you've always suspected was badly handled.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Objectives</h2>
      <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Determine if the three deaths were truly accidents/suicides or something more sinister</li>
        <li>Identify contradictions in the official story</li>
        <li>Find evidence of foul play (or prove it doesn't exist)</li>
        <li>Determine who benefited from these deaths and why</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p><strong>Your Advantages:</strong></p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Trained eye for inconsistencies and details</li>
        <li>Access to records and investigative networks</li>
        <li>Immunity to social pressure - you pursue truth, not popularity</li>
        <li>Skeptical nature means you won't be misled by surface-level explanations</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Your Challenges:</strong></p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Some townspeople may see you as troublemaker for questioning official stories</li>
        <li>The truth, when found, may implicate powerful people</li>
        <li>Evidence from 1925 may be buried or destroyed</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Notes for Play</h2>
      <p>You have no supernatural abilities. You're a skeptic who believes in evidence. Use your investigative skills to separate fact from fiction. Question everything. Trust no one completely until the evidence proves them trustworthy.</p>
      <p>Your strength is in your ability to see the bigger picture—how the pieces fit together, where the gaps are, what doesn't add up.</p>
