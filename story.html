      <h2>Prologue: The Inheritance</h2>
      <p>The letter arrived on a Tuesday morning, embossed with the seal of a generational wealth management firm.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Miss Montrose,</strong></p>
      <p style="font-style: italic; background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.1); padding: 15px; border-left: 3px solid #8b4513;">
        "We are writing to inform you that you are the heir to the Montrose family estate located at 266 Kennebec Avenue, Long Beach, California. The property has been held in trust for several decades, and our records indicate you are the closest living relative with a legal claim..."
      </p>

      <p>The Heiress—tired of her overbearing family, hungry for independence—saw opportunity. A mansion of her own? In Long Beach? How glamorous. How perfect. How bad could it be?</p>

      <p>The Fiduciary who tracked her down was thorough, pedantic, obsessed with proper documentation. They'd been managing the Montrose, Crane, and Whitmore estates for years. The mansion had been an eyesore, a wasted asset, abandoned for decades. If they could get someone to finally claim it, perhaps they could close this particular chapter of frustration.</p>

      <p>So the Heiress moved in, expecting elegance and independence.</p>

      <p>She discovered, instead, that she was not alone.</p>

      <h2>The Three Ghosts</h2>
      
      <h3>The Lonely Ghost - Alice Catherine Whitmore</h3>
      <p><strong>Age at death:</strong> 28 years old<br>
      <strong>Date of death:</strong> October 12, 1925<br>
      <strong>Cause of death (official):</strong> Accidental fall down the stairs<br>
      <strong>Cause of death (actual):</strong> Murdered by blunt force trauma</p>

      <p>At certain times of the evening, a ghost of a slim and frail young woman in a blue dress can be seen walking the halls of the mansion. She is often seen pacing the stairs, looking for her best friend Cordelia...</p>

      <p>Alice was psychic—truly gifted with visions and premonitions. What others dismissed as hysteria was real sensitivity to hidden truths. She was brilliant, loyal, protective of those she loved. Her best friend Cordelia was like a sister to her.</p>

      <p>She was in love with her doctor, Dr. Thaddeus Crane, but it was a forbidden love, an affair that had to be kept secret. It torn at Alice, but she couldn't help it. Unlike other "specialists" who believed she needed to be institutionalized, Thaddeus believed in her abilities and would listen. He genuinely cared for her or so it seemed... When he came to her for advice, she was heartbroken, but she was trying to do the right thing: she told Thaddeus to confess his crimes immediately.</p>

      <p>She was murdered, but she didn't see who it was... She just felt a movement, something heavy hit her head, then nothing.</p>

      <p>Her spirit is lonely because she lost her best friend, lost her secret lover, lost her own life, and spent 100 years unable to tell anyone what she knew. She's been calling out, trapped between worlds.</p>

      <h3>The Cursed Alchemist - Sebastian Montgomery Crane</h3>
      <p><strong>Age at death:</strong> 32 years old<br>
      <strong>Date of death:</strong> October 12 or 13, 1925<br>
      <strong>Cause of death (official):</strong> Poisoning, suspected homicide<br>
      <strong>Cause of death (actual):</strong> Accidentally poisoned by his own formula (which his brother had sabotaged)</p>

      <p>Sebastian was an apothecary with a real talent for making potions and tonics. Though he may have been somewhat of a rogue, many people also thought him to be a genius.</p>

      <p>He was involved in a bootlegging operation with Frankie Romano, the mob boss operating out of the Port of Long Beach during Prohibition era. His tonics were the perfect disguise as medicinal uses of alcohol were still legal at the time. In the Frankie's organization, he was known as "The Alchemist".</p>

      <p>Sebastian was obsessed with his "Great Work." He believed he could create an Elixir of Eternal Love—a potion to bind two hearts together forever. He was arrogant, romantic, convinced he'd mastered both chemistry and love. He administered the completely harmless (or so he thought) elixir to Cordelia believing it would strenthen their bond. Unknown to him, his brother had corrupted the formula with a deadly poison.</p>

      <p>Sebastian died never knowing he was innocent. He died thinking his own work had failed him: after he tasted his creation, he died within days.</p>

      <p>His spirit is cursed because he died in confusion and failure, believing he'd destroyed everything he loved through his own incompetence. He doesn't know the truth: someone else poisoned his work. So he cursed himself and his work leaving him trapped to haunt the mansion.</p>

      <h3>The Heartbroken Spirit - Cordelia Rose Montrose</h3>
      <p><strong>Age at death:</strong> 26 years old<br>
      <strong>Date of death:</strong> October 18, 1925<br>
      <strong>Cause of death (official):</strong> Heart failure, natural causes (rumored to be a broken heart)<br>
      <strong>Cause of death (actual):</strong> Slow poisoning with foxglove over 44 days</p>
      
      <p>The Heiress sometimes sees a ghost of a beautiful young woman with a large dark eyes and long dark hair sitting by the piano, playing a song she doesn't recognize. She is often seen crying, mourning her lost daughter and her lost love. This is the ghost of Cordelia Rose Montrose.</p>

      <p>Cordelia was once a romantic dreamer—the kind of girl who pressed flowers, saved love letters, and believed in destiny. But things change.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Thomas Whitmore</strong> was the older brother of her best friend Alice. He was her first love. When he sailed away and never returned—lost at sea, they said—Cordelia was already carrying his baby.</p>

      <p>She was sent away in shame, given birth to her daughter alone, and her family forced her to give the baby away. The Montroses were a respectable family, and everyone knew they would avoid a scandal at all costs. Cordelia's father, Cornelius Montrose, had a face that seemed to be cut out of stone. He was a man of few words and even fewer emotions—a man who would do anything to protect his reputation.</p>

      <p>After she was sent away and returned home without her child, Cordelia grew distant from Alice. She couldn't bear to see her best friend anymore—Alice was a living reminder of Thomas and the daughter she could never speak of.</p>

      <p>Years later, when she heard whispers about Dr. Thaddeus and Alice's affair, she felt like she had to do something. Alice seemed lonely and vulnerable. So Cordelia confronted Thaddeus with an ultimatum: end the affair immediately, or she would expose him to the medical board and to all of Long Beach society.</p>

      <p>When Sebastian came into her life, offering devotion and constancy, she chose him. She wanted stability. She wanted someone who wouldn't leave. And she was in love with him—in a different way than she'd been with Thomas. It was a mature love, something that felt more stable and secure.</p>

      <p>But she didn't know this very stability was slowly killing her. Over the course of six weeks, her body accumulated toxins from the foxglove. In her final days, sick and confused, dreadful news arrived that her best friend and fiancé were both dead. But all she could think of was her daughter, Eleanor. She desperately tried to find her in those last days.</p>

      <p>She never knew the real truth.</p>

      <p>She never knew the real truth.</p>

      <h2>The Murder: What Really Happened</h2>

      <h3>The Secret Affair (1924-1925)</h3>
      <p>Dr. Thaddeus Crane, the respected town physician and Sebastian's older brother, was conducting an illicit affair with one of his patients: <strong>Alice Whitmore</strong>.</p>

      <p>It violated every ethical boundary. Doctor-patient relationships were absolutely forbidden. But Alice was extraordinary—psychic, brilliant, sensitive to truths others couldn't see. She saw him, truly saw him, in ways no one else ever had. He was utterly consumed by her.</p>

      <p>They kept their relationship hidden. Secret meetings. Coded correspondence. The thrill and danger of something forbidden.</p>

      <p>And then Cordelia Montrose discovered their affair.</p>

      <h3>The Threat (Late Summer 1925)</h3>
      <p>Cordelia confronted Dr. Thaddeus with an ultimatum:</p>
      <p style="font-style: italic; background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.1); padding: 15px; border-left: 3px solid #8b4513;">
        "End the affair with Alice immediately, or I will expose you to the medical board and to all of Long Beach society. Your career will be destroyed. Your reputation will be ruined. Choose."
      </p>

      <p>Dr. Thaddeus was cornered. His entire professional and social life hung in the balance. Everything he'd built could be destroyed by one scandal.</p>

      <p>He realized he had only one way out: <strong>eliminate Cordelia.</strong></p>

      <h3>The Murder Weapon: A Poisoned Elixir</h3>
      <p>Dr. Thaddeus knew his younger brother Sebastian was working on a special project—the "Elixir of Eternal Love." Sebastian had consulted Professor Hartley about botanicals. He'd ordered rare plants from Harbor Import & Trading Co. (Frankie Romano's smuggling operation). He'd prepared the formula with obsessive precision.</p>

      <p>Thaddeus examined Sebastian's work. The elixir was harmless—foolish and overly romantic, yes, but not dangerous. A blend of aphrodisiacs, calming herbs, and flavorings designed to be given in small daily doses. Sebastian genuinely believed it would strengthen his bond with Cordelia.</p>

      <p>Thaddeus saw an opportunity.</p>

      <p>He obtained concentrated foxglove extract—digitalis purpurea, a powerful cardiac poison. Then he secretly added it to Sebastian's prepared elixir bottle, exponentially increasing the toxicity.</p>

      <p>He thought that was the perfect plan: no one would suspect poisoning, it would appear as a natural illness, all he had to do was add the poison to the bottle...</p>

      <h3>September 4, 1925 - The Jupiter-Venus Conjunction</h3>
      <p><strong>6:14 AM</strong> - Sebastian Crane administers the first dose of what he believes is his perfected Elixir of Eternal Love to Cordelia Montrose during the rare Jupiter-Venus conjunction. He has no idea his brother has corrupted the formula with concentrated foxglove.</p>

      <p>The timing is deliberate—alchemical tradition holds that conjunctions amplify the power of workings related to love and devotion. Sebastian believes this cosmic alignment will make his elixir perfect.</p>

      <p>He couldn't be more wrong.</p>

      <h3>September 4 - October 6, 1925 - The Slow Death</h3>
      <p>Every morning, Sebastian adds a teaspoon of the poisoned elixir to Cordelia's tea or coffee. He's devoted, attentive, convinced his formula is working.</p>

      <p>Cordelia begins showing symptoms: weakness, nausea, confusion, cardiac irregularities. But the doses are small and diluted. The poison accumulates slowly. She deteriorates but doesn't die quickly.</p>

      <p>No one suspects poisoning. Everyone assumes she has a mysterious illness.</p>

      <p>Alice Whitmore, her psychic best friend, senses something is terribly wrong. But she doesn't understand what yet.</p>

      <h3>October 7, 1925 - Sebastian's Discovery</h3>
      <p>After a month of daily doses, Sebastian grows concerned. Cordelia isn't developing "unwavering devotion"—she's getting sicker. His elixir should be strengthening their bond, not weakening her health.</p>

      <p>Confused and worried that his formula might be flawed, Sebastian does what any arrogant alchemist would do: <strong>he tests it on himself.</strong></p>

      <p>He drinks a concentrated dose directly from the preparation bottle—far more potent than the diluted amounts he's been giving Cordelia.</p>

      <p>The foxglove-laced elixir hits him immediately. Within hours, he's violently ill. Cardiac distress. Nausea. Confusion. The symptoms are catastrophic.</p>

      <h3>October 7-11, 1925 - The Desperate Antidote Search</h3>
      <p>Sebastian is dying. Dr. Thaddeus realizes with horror what he's done: <strong>He's murdered his own brother.</strong></p>

      <p>Sebastian wasn't supposed to taste the elixir! This was never part of the plan.</p>

      <p>Thaddeus is consumed with guilt and desperation. He begins frantically searching for an antidote:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li>Consulting botanical experts about foxglove toxicity</li>
        <li>Researching cardiac glycoside treatments in medical journals</li>
        <li>Purchasing strange chemicals and compounds</li>
        <li>Making notes about possible antidotes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This research leaves a trail of evidence—purchases, consultations, desperate medical notes—that will later help investigators piece together what really happened.</p>

      <p>But despite his medical knowledge, Thaddeus can't save his brother. Foxglove is cumulative and unforgiving. Once the damage is done, there's no reversing it.</p>

      <h3>October 10, 1925 (Evening) - The Confession</h3>
      <p>Sebastian is dying. Thaddeus is wracked with guilt. He needs to confess to someone, to share this unbearable secret.</p>

      <p>He goes to the one person he trusts completely: <strong>Alice Whitmore</strong>, his secret lover.</p>

      <p>He tells her everything:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li>Cordelia discovered their affair</li>
        <li>She threatened to expose him</li>
        <li>He poisoned Sebastian's elixir to kill Cordelia</li>
        <li>Sebastian unknowingly gave the poisoned formula to Cordelia</li>
        <li>Sebastian accidentally poisoned himself by testing his own work</li>
        <li>Now his brother is dying because of what Thaddeus did</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Thaddeus is desperate for absolution, for understanding, for Alice to tell him it will be okay. He confesses seeking comfort from the woman he loves.</p>

      <p>Alice is horrified.</p>

      <h3>October 11, 1925 - Alice's Ultimatum</h3>
      <p>Alice Whitmore urges Thaddeus to confess what he did. Maybe it's not too late to save them all. Maybe they can still be together. Maybe they can still be happy...</p>

      <p>Thaddeus realizes that Alice will not back down, will not understand, and he is consumed by fear. He knows he has to protect himself at all costs...</p>

      <h3>October 11, 1925 (Late Night) - The Third Murder</h3>
      <p>Desperate and cornered, Dr. Thaddeus murders Alice Whitmore to silence her.</p>

      <p><strong>Location:</strong> The mansion stairs<br>
      <strong>Weapon:</strong> A heavy silver candle holder<br>
      <strong>Method:</strong> Blunt force trauma to the head</p>

      <p>It happens in darkness. Alice doesn't see her killer's face—just a shadowy figure approaching...</p>

      <p>Thaddeus hits her on the head with a heavy silver candle holder, she is dead instantly.</p>

      <p>Thaddeus stages it to look like an accidental fall down the stairs. He knows the rumors about Alice—that she was "unstable," that she had "episodes," that she'd been drinking. People will believe she fell.</p>

      <p>The official story: Alice Whitmore, distraught and possibly intoxicated, fell down the stairs and died from the resulting head trauma. A tragic accident.</p>

      <h3>October 12 or 13, 1925 - Sebastian Dies</h3>
      <p>Sebastian Crane succumbs to the foxglove poisoning. He dies thinking his own formula failed, that his "Great Work" was flawed, that he somehow got the chemistry wrong.</p>

      <p>He never knows the truth: his brother corrupted his harmless elixir. He was innocent all along.</p>

      <p>Anyone who discovers Sebastian's Elixir of Eternal Love, feels goosbumps down their spine as they realize how true the name is to the truth... Anyone who discovers the elixir existed, will assume Sebastian poisoned his own fiancee.</p>

      <p>Official cause of death: Poisoning, suspected homicide. Everyone believes the mob (Frankie Romano) or his own criminal dealings finally caught up with him.</p>

      <h3>October 18, 1925 - Cordelia's Death</h3>
      <p>Six weeks after the first poisoned dose, Cordelia Montrose finally dies. Her body, weakened by 44 days of accumulated foxglove, gives out. Cardiac arrest. Multiple organ failure.</p>

      <p>Official cause of death: Heart failure, natural causes. Rumors spread that she died of a broken heart, devastated by Sebastian's death.</p>

      <h3>The Cover-Up</h3>
      <p>Dr. Thaddeus Crane signed all three death certificates. He's the attending physician for all three deaths:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li><strong>Alice Whitmore (Oct 12):</strong> Accidental fall</li>
        <li><strong>Sebastian Crane (Oct 12-13):</strong> Homicide—suspected poisoning</li>
        <li><strong>Cordelia Montrose (Oct 18):</strong> Natural causes—heart failure</li>
      </ul>

      <p>He anonymously sends a letter with payment to Silas Blackwell, the mortician: <strong>$500</strong> (equivalent to roughly $8,800 today) to keep quiet about any discrepancies in the death records.</p>

      <p>Silas notices immediately:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li>Alice's injury pattern doesn't match a simple fall</li>
        <li>Sebastian's symptoms suggest deliberate poisoning, not mob retaliation</li>
        <li>Cordelia shows signs of slow, accumulated poisoning—not natural heart failure</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For $500, Silas falsifies his private notes and stay silent. He believes the Montrose family paid him to cover up the scandal.</p>

      <h3>Concealing the Evidence (October 25, 1925)</h3>
      <p>Dr. Thaddeus seals Sebastian's laboratory. He moves everything to the abandoned section of the Montrose property—the garage that no one enters anymore.</p>

      <p>He hides:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li>Sebastian's alchemical notebooks and formulas</li>
        <li>Botanical specimens and preparation records</li>
        <li>Evidence of the antidote research</li>
        <li>His own medical notes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>He doesn't know that the elixir bottle still contains the traces of the elixir that killed Cordelia and Sebastian.</p>

      <p>In his diary, he writes:</p>
      <p style="font-style: italic; background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.1); padding: 15px; border-left: 3px solid #8b4513;">
        "I could not destroy it all. Perhaps someday someone should know. But not now. Not while I live."
      </p>

      <h3>The Guilt That Consumed Him</h3>
      <p>For the rest of his life, Dr. Thaddeus Crane was haunted:</p>
      <p style="font-style: italic; background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.1); padding: 15px; border-left: 3px solid #8b4513;">
        "Three death certificates in eleven days. I am complicit. I murdered my brother. I murdered the woman who loved me. I murdered Cordelia to protect an affair.<br><br>
        Alice saw me for what I truly am. When she threatened to expose me, I killed her without hesitation. The woman I loved—I killed her with these hands.<br><br>
        I cannot live with this. I cannot practice medicine knowing what I've done."
      </p>

      <p>He died in 1952, taking his terrible secret to the grave.</p>

      <h2>The Competing Narratives: Lies & Truth</h2>

      <h3>SEBASTIAN'S DEATH - What People Believe vs Reality</h3>

      <h4>❌ LIE #1: Frankie Romano Killed Sebastian</h4>
      <p><strong>The Story:</strong> Sebastian tried to leave Frankie's criminal operation when he got engaged. Everyone heard their violent argument at the docks. Frankie murdered Sebastian as a warning—you don't walk away from the Romano family.</p>
      <p><strong>Evidence Supporting This:</strong></p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li>Public dock argument between Frankie and Sebastian</li>
        <li>Dock workers' testimony about Frankie's rage</li>
        <li>Sebastian's diary: "Frankie won't let me leave. I'm afraid."</li>
        <li>Romano family's documented history of violence</li>
        <li>Method of death (poison) is typical mob signature</li>
        <li>Newspaper headline: "Local Pharmacist Found Dead—Mob Connection Suspected"</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Why It's Believed:</strong> It's the obvious story. Frankie is ruthless, the timing is suspicious, and Sebastian had clear mob connections.</p>

      <h4>❌ LIE #2: Montrose Family Killed Sebastian</h4>
      <p><strong>The Story:</strong> The powerful Montrose family had Sebastian eliminated to prevent him from marrying their daughter. A pharmacist with criminal connections would destroy their reputation. They're ruthless enough to do it.</p>
      <p><strong>Evidence Supporting This:</strong></p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li>Montrose family documented as ruthless (see: Baker's family arson)</li>
        <li>Private investigator reports showing they researched Sebastian's background</li>
        <li>Financial records showing large Montrose expenditures in October 1925</li>
        <li>They had motive (protecting reputation), means (wealth), and opportunity</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>❌ LIE #3: Elias Monroe (The Dressmaker) Killed Sebastian</h4>
      <p><strong>The Story:</strong> The rival dressmaker, obsessed with Cordelia and jealous of Sebastian, poisoned him to eliminate his competition. Elias had access to the mansion, constantly warned Cordelia not to marry Sebastian, and was documented as unhealthily fixated on her.</p>
      <p><strong>Evidence Supporting This:</strong></p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li>Elias's desperate love letters to Cordelia</li>
        <li>His constant warnings against the marriage</li>
        <li>Witnesses saw arguments between Elias and Sebastian</li>
        <li>He had access during dress fittings</li>
        <li>Clear motive: obsessive jealousy</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>✅ TRUTH: Dr. Thaddeus Accidentally Poisoned Sebastian</h4>
      <p><strong>The Reality:</strong> Sebastian died from testing his own Elixir of Eternal Love—which his brother Dr. Thaddeus had secretly sabotaged with concentrated foxglove. Sebastian was innocent, just making a harmless romantic potion. He died never knowing his brother corrupted his work to murder Cordelia.</p>
      <p><strong>Evidence Proving This:</strong></p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li>Sebastian's notebooks showing a HARMLESS formula (before tampering)</li>
        <li>Dr. Thaddeus's diary confessing to adding foxglove</li>
        <li>Antidote research trail (Oct 7-11) showing Thaddeus's desperate attempts to save Sebastian</li>
        <li>Professor Hartley's consultation notes showing Sebastian ordered NON-LETHAL botanicals</li>
        <li>Medical analysis: The poison in Sebastian's system is concentrated foxglove—far beyond what his formula called for</li>
        <li>Timeline: Sebastian died shortly after tasting the concentrated version</li>
        <li>The intact poison bottle in the Art Collector's possession (still contains residue)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>ALICE'S DEATH - What People Believe vs Reality</h3>

      <h4>❌ LIE #1: Alice Fell Down the Stairs</h4>
      <p><strong>The Story:</strong> Tragic accident. Alice was known to be "unstable" (her psychic abilities misunderstood as mental illness), possibly drunk or delirious. She either fell accidentally or took her own life.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It's Believed:</strong> The official death certificate says accidental fall. Alice's reputation as "unstable" makes suicide or accident seem plausible.</p>

      <h4>❌ LIE #2: Sebastian Killed Alice</h4>
      <p><strong>The Story:</strong> Alice discovered Sebastian was poisoning Cordelia. She confronted him, threatened to expose him. He killed her to silence her. Then he died shortly after from his own conscience or mob retaliation.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It's Believed:</strong> The timing is perfect. Alice dies, then Sebastian dies. It looks like murder followed by justice.</p>

      <h4>✅ TRUTH: Dr. Thaddeus Murdered Alice</h4>
      <p><strong>The Reality:</strong> After confessing to Alice that he'd poisoned the elixir and accidentally killed his brother, Alice threatened to expose him. Dr. Thaddeus killed her with a silver candle holder (blunt force trauma) and staged it as an accidental fall.</p>
      <p><strong>Evidence Proving This:</strong></p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li>Medical examination: Injury pattern inconsistent with simple fall</li>
        <li>Alice's medical records proving she had no suicidal tendencies</li>
        <li>The silver candle holder at the mansion (murder weapon)</li>
        <li>Dr. Thaddeus's diary admitting he killed Alice</li>
        <li>Timeline: Alice died the same night she threatened to expose Thaddeus</li>
        <li>Alice's psychic notes suggesting she knew dangerous secrets</li>
        <li>Mortician Silas Blackwell's private notes documenting discrepancies</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>CORDELIA'S DEATH - What People Believe vs Reality</h3>

      <h4>❌ LIE #1: Cordelia Died of a Broken Heart</h4>
      <p><strong>The Story:</strong> When Sebastian died (or abandoned her), Cordelia couldn't bear it. Already fragile from her secret pregnancy scandal, she wasted away from grief. Natural causes—heartbreak can kill.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It's Believed:</strong> It's romantic, tragic, and fits 1920s understanding of women as emotionally fragile.</p>

      <h4>❌ LIE #2: Sebastian Poisoned Cordelia</h4>
      <p><strong>The Story:</strong> Sebastian deliberately poisoned his fiancée with his "Elixir of Eternal Love" because he was jealous and obsessive. He wanted to bind her to him forever, but the formula killed her instead.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It's Believed:</strong> Sebastian was making an elixir, Cordelia was being poisoned, and he died shortly after—it seems obvious.</p>

      <h4>✅ TRUTH: Dr. Thaddeus Poisoned Cordelia</h4>
      <p><strong>The Reality:</strong> Dr. Thaddeus sabotaged Sebastian's harmless elixir by adding concentrated foxglove, intending to kill Cordelia to prevent her from exposing his affair with Alice. Sebastian unknowingly administered the poison daily from September 4 to October 6, thinking he was strengthening their bond. Cordelia died October 18 from accumulated toxin damage.</p>
      <p><strong>Evidence Proving This:</strong></p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li>Dr. Thaddeus's confession in his sealed diary</li>
        <li>Medical analysis showing cumulative foxglove poisoning over 6 weeks</li>
        <li>Sebastian's original harmless formula vs. the corrupted poisoned version</li>
        <li>Cordelia's diary showing she threatened Thaddeus about the affair</li>
        <li>Timeline: First dose September 4, death October 18 (44 days of accumulation)</li>

      Prepared for Jupiter-Venus Conjunction | September 4, 1925, 6:14 AM</p>

      <h3>Sebastian's Original Formula (HARMLESS):</h3>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li><strong>Damiana (Turnera diffusa):</strong> 5 drops daily - aphrodisiac properties</li>
        <li><strong>Valerian Root:</strong> Small amount - calming agent</li>

      <h2>The Secret Baby: Cordelia & Thomas</h2>

      <h3>The Sailor Romance (2023)</h3>
      <p>In October 2023, Cordelia Montrose—romantic, dreamy, 25 years old—met <strong>Thomas Edward Whitmore</strong> at the Port of Long Beach. He was about 30, a merchant marine captain and the older brother of her best friend Alice.</p>

      <p>Thomas was everything her sheltered life wasn't: adventurous, worldly, free. He told her stories of exotic ports and distant horizons. He promised to take her away, show her the world.</p>

      <p>It was a whirlwind romance. Passionate. All-consuming. The kind of love that burns bright and fast.</p>

      <p>In November 2023, she became pregnant.</p>

      <p>Then in December 2023, Thomas sailed away. Did he mean to come back? Did he truly love her? We'll never know.</p>

      <p><strong>He left without knowing Cordelia was pregnant.</strong></p>

      <h3>The Scandal & The Cover-Up (January - July 2024)</h3>
      <p>The Montrose family was horrified. An unmarried daughter pregnant by a sailor? Unacceptable. In January 2024, they sent Cordelia away on "vacation" for months. Her friend Alice complained that Cordelia had become distant, was never around.</p>

      <p>In secret, in July 2024, Cordelia gave birth to a baby girl.</p>

      <p>The Montrose family arranged for the baby to be given to the Sullivan family—respectable bakers in Long Beach. The baby would be raised as theirs.</p>

      <p><strong>Critical detail: The adoption was never legally finalized.</strong></p>

      <p>On paper, that baby remained Cordelia Montrose's legitimate heir. The true heir to the entire Montrose estate.</p>

      <p>Thomas Whitmore died at sea in 2024 or 2025, never knowing he had a daughter.</p>

      <h3>Generation 1: Eleanor Rose Sullivan (Born July 2024)</h3>
      <p>The baby grew up as Eleanor Sullivan. She never knew her birth parents. In her diary, she wrote about being adopted, about searching for identity, about the hollow place where belonging should be.</p>

      <p>She preserved one treasure: "my grandmother's bread recipe"—perhaps the only real inheritance she had.</p>

      <h3>Generations 2 & 3: The Baker Family</h3>
      <p>Eleanor's descendants ran the Sullivan bakery for generations. They used that bread recipe. They were good people—hardworking, known in the community.</p>

      <p>None of them knew they were descended from the Montrose family. None knew they were the legal heirs.</p>

      <p>But in the 1980s or 1990s, somehow the Montrose family discovered the truth.</p>

      <h3>The Night of the Fire (The Murder)</h3>
      <p>The present-day Montrose family was ruthless. The Sullivan family was a threat—true heirs who could legally claim everything.</p>

      <p><strong>So they hired an arsonist.</strong></p>

      <p>Late one night, the arsonist came to the Sullivan bakery. The Baker's mother realized what was happening. While pleading for her baby's life, she made one final act:</p>

      <p><strong>She tucked Eleanor's diary under the baby's blankets. Hidden. Her last gift.</strong></p>

      <p>The arsonist murdered the Baker's parents and grandparents. Started the fire. Destroyed the bakery and any trace of the Sullivan-Montrose connection.</p>

      <p>But the arsonist couldn't kill the baby. Maybe conscience, maybe mercy, maybe fear. The baby was taken to an orphanage—with the diary hidden in the blankets, unseen.</p>

      <h3>Generation 4: The Baker (Present Day)</h3>
      <p>The Baker grew up an orphan with only that diary—written by someone named Eleanor who also didn't know where she came from.</p>

      <p>The bread recipe became everything. The Baker learned to bake it perfectly, opened their own bakery, felt closer to family they never knew.</p>

      <p><strong>And they inherited psychic sensitivity</strong>—from Alice Whitmore through her brother Thomas to Cordelia's baby and down the generations.</p>

      <h3>What the Baker Doesn't Know:</h3>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li>They're descended from Cordelia Montrose</li>
        <li>Thomas Whitmore was their great-great-grandfather</li>
        <li>Alice Whitmore was their great-great-grand-aunt</li>
        <li><strong>They are the TRUE HEIR to the Montrose estate</strong></li>
        <li>The Heiress is a distant cousin but NOT the legal heir</li>
        <li>Their family was murdered to prevent them claiming their inheritance</li>
        <li>The diary is the key to their identity</li>
        <li>They're investigating their own great-great-grandmother's murder</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Romano Family: Mob to Art Dealing</h2>

      <h3>1920s - The Foundation</h3>
      <p><strong>Frankie "the Coast" Romano</strong> built his fortune through rum running at the Port of Long Beach during Prohibition. He was ruthless, connected, respected in the underworld.</p>

      <p>He supplied Sebastian Crane with:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li>Bootleg alcohol for pharmaceutical "tonics"</li>
        <li>Rare chemical ingredients smuggled through Harbor Import & Trading Co.</li>
        <li>Exotic botanical specimens</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Frankie also knew Thomas Whitmore (the sailor) through the docks, which gave him knowledge about Cordelia's secret pregnancy.</p>

      <h3>The Dock Argument (September 1925)</h3>
      <p>Sebastian wanted to leave the operation after getting engaged. Frankie was furious—they'd just started making real profit. The public argument at the docks made everyone think Frankie killed Sebastian later.</p>

      <p>But he didn't. Sebastian's death was Dr. Thaddeus's doing.</p>

      <h3>1930s-1950s - Hollywood Glory</h3>
      <p>The Romano family pivoted to entertainment—nightclubs, gambling, Hollywood connections. Flashy, notorious, tabloid-famous. New money at its trashiest and most visible.</p>

      <h3>1960s-1980s - The Collapse</h3>
      <p>IRS investigations destroyed the family. Everything was seized. The Romano fortune was gone.</p>

      <p>What survived:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li>An ornate glass bottle (the actual elixir bottle from Sebastian's lab)</li>
        <li>Shipping manifests and business records</li>
        <li>Family photographs</li>
        <li>Personal correspondence</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Present Day: The Art Collector</h3>
      <p><strong>Andy Romano</strong> grew up on faded glory and family shame. Learned art dealing through necessity, discovered genuine talent.</p>

      <p>Now runs a legitimate business—but still dabbles in shady deals. One foot in legitimacy, one in the shadows. The Romano way.</p>

      <p><strong>The Glass Bottle:</strong> Andy displays the ornate bottle proudly as a family heirloom, completely unaware it held the poison that killed three people. It's been in the family for 100 years—recovered from Sebastian's laboratory after the deaths, kept as a mysterious artifact from the family's criminal past.</p>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>The Family Name Change: Crane to Sinclair</h2>

      <h3>The Shame That Lasted Decades</h3>
      <p>After the three deaths in October 1925, the Crane name became synonymous with scandal. Everyone "knew" Sebastian was involved in bootlegging, had mob connections, probably murdered Alice, definitely poisoned people.</p>

      <p>For forty years, the family lived under this cloud.</p>

      <h3>1965 - The Name Change Petition</h3>
      <p>Dr. Thaddeus's son (Sebastian's nephew) filed legal papers to change the family surname from <strong>Crane to Sinclair</strong>.</p>

      <p style="font-style: italic; background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.1); padding: 15px; border-left: 3px solid #8b4513;">
        "Petitioner seeks to change family surname to eliminate association with historical criminal activities that have negatively impacted family standing and petitioner's political aspirations. The Crane name has become connected with bootlegging operations and unsavory business dealings from the Prohibition era."
      </p>

      <p>The petition was granted. The family became Sinclair. Sebastian was erased from history—his name, his work, his existence systematically buried.</p>

      <h3>Present Day: Dr. Sinclair</h3>
      <p><strong>Dr. Sinclair</strong> grew up believing they descended from a respectable town doctor. They never heard about an uncle named Sebastian. The family buried everything.</p>

      <p>Then a box arrived from the Fiduciary containing:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li>Sebastian Montgomery Crane's birth certificate</li>
        <li>His pharmaceutical business license</li>
        <li>Purchase ledgers showing botanical orders</li>
        <li>Evidence of a brother completely erased from family history</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Now Dr. Sinclair is discovering the dark secret that haunted their family for generations—and realizing their ancestor Dr. Thaddeus was not a victim of scandal, but the actual murderer.</p>
