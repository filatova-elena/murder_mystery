      "content": "The Art Collector and the Explorer locked eyes from across the room, each taking the other's measure.\n\n<em>What is he doing here?</em>\n\nThe thought occurred to both of them simultaneously.\n\n<em>Does he know about the Romano treasure?</em>\n\nThe Art Collector shifted his weight, his practiced eye assessing the Explorer's worn leather jacket, the weathered canvas bag slung over his shoulder, the way he studied the mansion's architecture like he was cataloging escape routes and hidden spaces.\n\nA treasure hunter. Obviously. Professional, by the look of him.\n\nThe Art Collector's family name carried weight in Long Beach—but not the kind he preferred to advertise. His great-great-grandfather was Frankie \"the Coast\" Romano, the notorious rum-runner who'd controlled bootlegging operations at the Port of Long Beach during Prohibition.\n\nThe Romano family had it all in the 1920s through the 1950s: money, power, connections, glamour. Nightclubs where Hollywood starlets danced. Politicians in their pocket. A mansion in the hills. They were untouchable.\n\nUntil they weren't.\n\nThe IRS investigations began in the 1960s and dragged on through the 1980s. The government seized everything—the nightclubs, the properties, the legitimate businesses Frankie had used to launder his empire. Bank accounts frozen. Assets auctioned. The Romano name became synonymous with scandal and downfall.\n\nBut there were rumors. Whispers passed down through the family like heirlooms. Hidden wealth that had escaped the IRS. Gold, cash, jewelry—secreted away before the feds came knocking. The legendary \"Romano treasure.\"\n\nWas it real? Or just a desperate family myth, something to cling to when the money ran out and the creditors came calling?\n\nThe Art Collector intended to find out.\n\nHe'd learned the art world by necessity, selling off salvaged family pieces to survive—a Tiffany lamp here, a piece of art deco furniture there. Slowly liquidating what little remained of the Romano legacy.\n\nBut one piece he could never bring himself to sell: an ornate glass bottle, Venetian glass from the 1920s, exquisite workmanship. Cobalt blue with gold filigree. It had belonged to Frankie himself, sat on his desk in his office at the port. Family legend said it once held his finest bootleg gin.\n\nWhen the Art Collector heard about the investigation at the old Montrose mansion—where his ancestor Frankie had done business in the 1920s—he couldn't resist.\n\nMaybe the treasure was real. Maybe it was here."

      "content": "He studied the Explorer again, noting how the man's gaze lingered on architectural details, on the paneling that might hide secret compartments, on the floorboards that might conceal a hidden vault.\n\nThe Art Collector knew the Whitmore name. It was famous in certain circles—always chasing legends, tracking down lost artifacts, recovering hidden wealth from forgotten places. Ships sunk in the Pacific. Temples in Southeast Asia. Lost fortunes in European vaults.\n\nHe must know about the Romano treasure, the Art Collector thought, his jaw tightening. That's why he's here. He knows Frankie did business with the Montroses. He knows the property's been abandoned for decades. If the treasure exists, this is where it would be hidden.\n\nI need to find it first.\n\nAcross the room, the Explorer was having remarkably similar thoughts.\n\nHe'd recognized the Art Collector immediately—it was his job to know the players in the artifact recovery world. And a Romano, here, at this mansion? That wasn't coincidence.\n\nHe must be here for the treasure, the Explorer thought. His reputation speaks for itself. Selling off pieces of the family fortune, always looking for the next score. He knows something. I need to find it first.\n\nBut something about this mansion felt... strange to the Explorer. Not threatening, exactly. More like—\n\nFamiliar.\n\nLike he'd been here before, though he knew he hadn't. Like the walls themselves were whispering recognition. The floorboards creaked in rhythms he somehow anticipated. The shadows fell in patterns that felt right.\n\nRidiculous, he told himself firmly. My family name is Whitmore. It's common enough. What possible connection could there be?\n\nHe'd come here for the treasure. For the adventure. For the thrill of solving a century-old mystery and recovering lost wealth.\n\nNothing more.\n\nAnd yet, as he stood in the dusty main hall of the Montrose mansion, surrounded by ghosts and secrets, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was meant to be here.\n\nThat somehow, this place was part of his story too."

      "title": "A Vision in the Garden",
      "content": "The Explorer approached the old laboratory building, his flashlight cutting through the darkness. The night had grown cold, fog rolling in from the ocean, turning everything ghostly and indistinct.\n\nHe consulted his map—a hand-drawn diagram he'd pieced together from old property records and bootlegging route documents. If Frankie Romano had hidden anything at the Montrose estate, it would be somewhere unexpected. Somewhere that looked abandoned but was actually—\n\nMovement. To his left.\n\nThe Explorer spun, flashlight raised. Nothing. Just the overgrown garden, rose bushes gone wild, shadows shifting in the wind.\n\nThen a cold breeze passed over him—colder than natural, raising goosebumps on his arms. The air itself seemed to thicken, charged with something he couldn't name. A presence.\n\nHis flashlight flickered.\n\nAnd then he saw her.\n\nA woman stood in the garden path, no more than ten feet away. She wore a light blue dress in the style of the 1920s—dropped waist, delicate lace at the collar. Her blonde hair was styled in the fashion of the era, pinned in soft waves close to her head. Her features were delicate, almost ethereal. But she was translucent, glowing faintly in the darkness, as if lit from within by moonlight.\n\n<img src=\"../assets/alice_ghost_vision.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Alice's ghostly apparition in the garden\">\n\nThe Explorer's breath caught.\n\nShe stared at him with an expression of desperate hope, her eyes bright with tears.\n\n\"Thomas?\" Her voice was a whisper, distant and close all at once. \"Is that you?\"\n\nThe Explorer couldn't move. Couldn't speak.\n\n\"You came back!\" The ghost—because what else could she be—stepped closer, her movements fluid and strange, not quite touching the ground. \"I thought you would! I was losing hope, but in my visions you were there—alive, lost at sea, but alive. And now you're here. You came back to me. Oh Thomas, how glad I am to see you!\"\n\nShe reached out her hand toward him, her face radiant with joy and relief.\n\nThe Explorer stumbled backward, his rational mind screaming. He squeezed his eyes shut, pressing his palms against his temples.\n\nNot real. Stress. Exhaustion. Power of suggestion. All these ghost stories are getting to me.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, she was gone.\n\nJust the garden. Just the wind. Just the fog rolling through the overgrown roses.\n\n\"Jesus,\" he muttered, his heart still racing. He wiped his forehead with a shaking hand. \"Ghosts. Right. I'm seeing things.\"\n\nBut something about her voice had felt... familiar. Like an echo of something he'd heard before. Something he should remember but couldn't quite grasp.\n\nThomas. She'd called him Thomas.\n\nThe Explorer shook his head sharply, forcing himself to focus. He pulled out his map again, consulting it by flashlight.\n\n\"Rose garden planters,\" he read aloud, his voice steadier now. \"Should be just about... here.\"\n\nHe moved deeper into the garden, stepping over broken trellises and tangled vines, looking for the old stone planters that marked the corners of what had once been an elaborate formal rose garden."

      "content": "The Art Collector moved through the mansion methodically, his trained eye cataloging every piece of furniture, every painting, every decorative object that remained. His notebook filled with observations:\n\n<div class=\"art-notes\">Oil on canvas, approx 24x30\" - three bears in birch forest - Russian school, late 19th/early 20th century - Cyrillic signature lower right, illegible - primitive style, folk art tradition - canvas shows age but stable - gilt frame damaged - moderate value to right collector, $2-4K estimate\n\nOil on canvas, 30x40\" - flamenco dancer in red dress - Spanish, definitely Andalusian influence - bold impasto technique, dramatic use of shadow - unsigned but quality suggests trained artist - 1920s era by costume details - frame ornate gold leaf, some losses - good auction potential, $5-8K if authenticated</div>\n\nThe Art Collector made a note to research Spanish artists working in California in the 1920s. Several had come through Los Angeles during that period.\n\nHow had Romano collection pieces ended up here? The Art Collector had a theory: When the IRS investigations began in the 1960s, someone in the family had hidden the most valuable items in this abandoned property. The Montrose mansion had been empty since the deaths in 1925, sitting in legal limbo. A perfect hiding place.\n\nHe continued along the wall, documenting each piece methodically.\n\nAnd then he stopped.\n\n<div class=\"discovery\">Oil on canvas, 36x28\" - woman at table with wine glass - Art Nouveau style, 1920s - South American, possibly Argentinian by the color palette and composition - unsigned visible but may be under grime</div>\n\nThe Art Collector leaned closer, his pulse quickening.\n\nThe woman in the painting wore an elegant evening gown in deep jewel tones. She sat at a small table, and she held a wine glass delicately in her hand, lifted to her face. But she wasn't drinking from it. She was gazing into it—looking deeply into the glass itself, as if trying to read something in its depths, as if the wine held secrets or visions.\n\nThe Art Collector fumbled for his phone and scrolled through his photos until he found it—a scan of a page from Frankie Romano's personal journal.\n\nThere. The entry from August 1925:\n\n<div class=\"journal-entry\"><em>\"Moved the collection to the M. house. Everything's secure. If the boys ever need to find it, I left them a map. Tell them to find the lady with the wine glass—watch how she looks inside. That's the trick. Purple dreams and golden promises—that's where the real treasure sleeps.\"</em></div>\n\nThe lady with the wine glass—watch how she looks inside.\n\nInside.\n\n\"It's a riddle,\" he whispered. \"Look inside.\"\n\nBut inside what?\n\nHe moved through the room more carefully now, searching. Looking for something purple with golden highlights. Something that matched Frankie's cryptic description.\n\nAnd there—in the corner, on a side table beneath a dust sheet—he found it.\n\nA vase. Large, ornate, unmistakably Venetian. Deep purple glass with golden highlights swirling through it like captured starlight. Late 19th century craftsmanship, possibly Murano. The work was extraordinary—masterful glassblowing technique, the gold inclusions perfectly distributed.\n\nThe Art Collector approached it slowly, his hands trembling.\n\nPurple dreams and golden promises.\n\nThis was it.\n\nAnd the riddle: look inside.\n\nHe picked up the vase carefully, noting its substantial weight—at least fifteen pounds. Museum quality piece, easily worth $10-15K on its own. He tilted it, peering into the opening. At first he saw nothing—just the dark interior of the glass. But then, wedged deep inside the narrow neck, he caught a glimpse of something pale.\n\nPaper.\n\n\"No way,\" he breathed.\n\nHe looked around quickly, making sure he was alone, then carefully worked his fingers into the vase's opening. The paper was old, brittle—had to be from the 1920s or earlier. He had to be gentle. Slowly, painstakingly, he coaxed it out.\n\nA map.\n\n<img src=\"../assets/treasure_map.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Frankie's hand-drawn treasure map\">\n\nHand-drawn on yellowed paper, the ink faded but still legible. A rough sketch of the mansion grounds, focusing on the garden area. And there, marked with a bold red X circled multiple times: a spot near the rose bushes.\n\nBelow the map, instructions in Frankie's handwriting:\n\n40 paces north from the iron gate\n9 paces west\nUnder the lady's feet\n\nThe Art Collector stared at the map, barely breathing.\n\nThis was it. The Romano treasure. Real. Here.

      "content": "The Art Collector headed for the door, trying to walk calmly, trying not to run.\n\nBefore someone else figured it out. Before the Explorer—who was probably already out there searching—found it first.\n\nBut when he reached the garden, he found the Explorer already there, on his knees, digging with a folding shovel, his flashlight propped against a rose bush.\n\nThe Explorer spun around, shovel raised defensively, his face a mixture of shock and anger. \"What the hell—were you following me?\"\n\n\"No. I found my own way here.\" The Art Collector held up his phone, showing the photograph of the map. \"But you're digging three feet too far east.\"\n\nThe Explorer's eyes narrowed, studying the Art Collector, then the phone screen, calculating risks and possibilities. \"And you just thought you'd share that information out of the goodness of your heart?\"\n\n\"I thought,\" the Art Collector said carefully, \"that if we both want what's buried here, and we're both descendants of people connected to this mansion, we might consider being strategic instead of stupid.\"\n\n\"Strategic how?\"\n\n\"We work together. We split whatever we find.\" The Art Collector stepped closer. \"You've clearly got skills I don't—you found the general location without a map. I've got the exact coordinates. Separately, we're competitors. Together, we're efficient.\"\n\nThe Explorer was silent for a long moment, his jaw tight. Then: \"Fifty-fifty split. Whatever's down there.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\"\n\nThe Art Collector pulled out his own phone's compass and paced off the distance from the iron gate. \"Forty paces north from the gate...\"\n\nThe Explorer followed, counting silently.\n\n\"Now nine paces west.\"\n\nThey stopped at a spot about three feet from where the Explorer had been digging. An unremarkable patch of ground beneath a large stone planter shaped like an urn—classical style, probably original to the 1910s mansion construction.\n\n\"Under the lady's feet,\" the Art Collector murmured, looking at the planter. The stone urn sat on a base carved with classical figures—nymphs and goddesses dancing in relief. One goddess stood slightly apart from the others, her bare feet clearly visible in the carved stone.\n\n\"That's it,\" the Explorer breathed.\n\nThey both knelt and began to dig, the Explorer with his folding shovel, the Art Collector using his hands to scoop away the loose dirt the Explorer had already displaced nearby.\n\nThe soil was soft from decades of garden watering and rain. They worked quickly, quietly, glancing occasionally toward the mansion to make sure no one else was coming.\n\nTwo feet down. Three feet.\n\nThen—\n\nThunk.\n\nThe Explorer's shovel hit something solid.\n\nThey both froze, eyes meeting in the darkness.\n\n\"That's not a rock,\" the Explorer whispered.\n\nThey dug more carefully now, using their hands to brush away the soil. The object revealed itself gradually—a corner, a flat surface, metal edges.\n\nA box. Heavy gauge steel, about two feet square, with a lock that had long since rusted through.\n\nTogether, they heaved it out of the hole and set it on the grass. It was heavy—at least fifty pounds. Substantial.\n\nThe Art Collector's hands were shaking as he worked the corroded lock. The Explorer held the flashlight steady.\n\nThe lock broke with a grinding snap.\n\nThe Art Collector lifted the lid.\n\nAnd there, packed carefully in oilcloth that had mostly disintegrated, was Frankie Romano's hidden fortune:\n\n<div class=\"treasure-contents\">Stacks of cash—bills from the 1920s and '30s, probably worthless as currency but valuable to collectors. Gold coins—twenty-dollar Liberty pieces, worth their weight at minimum, possibly more. A leather pouch that clinked with what could only be jewelry. Several smaller wooden boxes, contents unknown. And wrapped in silk that had rotted to fragments—</div>\n\n\"Is that what I think it is?\" the Explorer breathed.\n\nThe Art Collector lifted out a painting, carefully rolled and protected in a metal tube. He opened the tube and partially unrolled the canvas.\n\nEven in the dim flashlight beam, even covered in a century of dust, the quality was unmistakable.\n\n\"That's not a reproduction,\" the Art Collector said, his voice hushed with awe. \"That's... that could be worth more than everything else combined.\"\n\nThey stared at the contents of the box—at Frankie Romano's insurance policy, his safety net, his hidden legacy that had waited a hundred years in the dark earth.\n\n\"We found it,\" the Explorer said, almost laughing. \"We actually found it.\"\n\n\"The Romano treasure,\" the Art Collector agreed, a smile spreading across his face. \"It's real.\"\n\n\"We should get this inside,\" the Explorer said. \"Before someone else comes looking.\"\n\n\"Agreed. We'll inventory everything properly, figure out fair division—\"\n\n\"Later. Right now, let's just get it secured.\"\n\nTogether, they lifted the heavy box and began carrying it back toward the mansion, partners now instead of rivals.\n\nNeither of them noticed the translucent figure watching from the shadows of the mansion's upper window—a woman in a 1920s dress, her form glowing faintly in the darkness, her expression unreadable as she observed the two men carrying away what had been buried so long ago.\n\nNeither of them realized that the treasure they'd found—while valuable—was not the only secret buried in the grounds of the Montrose estate.\n\nAnd neither of them knew that by finding the Romano treasure, they'd just set in motion the final pieces of a mystery that had waited a century to be solved."
