      "content": "<i><u>First Principles</u>\n\nWhat is love but chemistry? The ancients knew this—Venus governing desire, the quickening of pulse, the movement of blood toward heat. They poeticized what we may now quantify.\n\nIf attraction is chemistry, then chemistry may produce attraction.\n\nThe question is not whether it can be done, but how elegantly. The formula must work on two levels: the corporeal (the body's response) and the metaphysical (the soul's recognition).\n\nI have begun my research.\n\n<img src=\"../assets/sebastian_heart_diagram.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Sebastian's heart diagram sketch\">\n\n[Sketch: circular diagram with a heart at center, radiating outward in concentric rings.

What speaks to commitment, to the eternal quality of true love?\n\nI'll find it. I know I will.\n\nAnd when I do—when I finally meet HER—when the woman worthy of my finest work crosses my path\n\nI will be prepared.\n\nThe formula will be perfect.</i>"

      "content": "<img src=\"../assets/speakeasy_scene.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Sebastian and Cordelia meet in the speakeasy\">\n\nIt was a warm September evening, the air thick with distant salt of the sea and promise. Fallen sycamore leaves scattered across Kennebec Avenue, and the tall Mexican Fan Palms lining the street swayed like a conspiracy of gossiping teenagers, their fronds whispering secrets against the darkening sky.\n\nCordelia had been back in Long Beach for weeks now, but she still couldn't bring herself to slip back into her old self. Her mother and father had resumed their routines as though nothing had happened—dinner parties, business calls, polite society. She almost wished they'd remained cold and distant.\n\nShe'd had enough of pretending.\n\nTonight, she told herself, she would start living the way Thomas had lived—boldly, freely, without fear of consequence.\n\nHer young cousin Mary had told her about the speakeasies. Mary, who presented such a perfect image of virtue to society while being the most delightfully mischievous creature alive. They'd arranged to meet by the bank building on Pine Avenue after dark.\n\nCordelia waited until the household had gone to bed, then slipped out of the mansion like a thief, her heart pounding with equal parts fear and exhilaration.\n\nThe speakeasies were forbidden. Illegal. Dangerous.\n\nShe felt alive for the first time in months.\n\n---\n\nSebastian Crane stood in the corner of the speakeasy, dark eyes surveying the crowd with amusement. The air was thick with jazz music, cigarette smoke, and the sharp tang of bootleg gin.\n\nHe'd always been the black sheep of the Crane family. His brother Thaddeus was the golden child—the physician, beloved by Long Beach society. Sebastian, on the other hand, had spent his childhood setting small fires during chemistry experiments and mixing volatile compounds in his father's shed. His parents had been equal parts proud and exasperated.\n\nNow he was a pharmacist by day, chemist by nature, and opportunist by necessity. Prohibition had been a gift to men like him. Through his connection with Frankie Romano at the port, Sebastian supplied half the speakeasies in Long Beach with grain alcohol—all perfectly legal, of course. Medical supplies. Medicinal tonics. The paperwork was impeccable. Among certain circles, he'd earned a reputation: they called him The Alchemist, a man who could transmute legality into fortune, who understood that the right chemistry could transform anything—prohibition into profit, powder into potion, law into opportunity.\n\nHe watched the crowd with detached interest. Respectable people pretending to be dangerous, their laughter a touch too loud, their movements a touch too reckless. Playing at rebellion.\n\nThen he heard laughter to his right—bright and unrestrained.\n\nHe turned.\n\nThe woman had large brown eyes that caught the low lamplight, sparkling with mischief. High society, certainly—he could tell by the cut of her dress, the way she held herself. But there was something untamed about her, something that didn't quite fit the polished surface. When she laughed, she wasn't pretending.\n\nTheir eyes met across the hazy room.\n\nShe smiled at him—not coy, not calculated. Just smiled, as if she'd found something surprising and delightful.\n\nSebastian couldn't look away."

Pursuing a Montrose?\" - Clarence Montrose's usually immovable face twisted into a mask of anger.\n\n\"I've made inquiries about the Crane boy,\" said Margaret Montrose, settling into the chair across from his desk. She held a small sheaf of notes. \"Sebastian Crane. He's the younger brother of Dr. Thaddeus Crane—quite well-regarded as a physician. Their father was also a doctor, respected in his time. The family has standing.\"\n\n\"He's a pharmacist.\" Clarence Montrose's face remained immobile, carved from stone. \"Hardly a suitable match for a Montrose.\"\n\n\"You know very well, Clarence,\" Margaret said carefully, her thin face angled toward him, \"why we cannot afford to be particular.\"\n\nHis jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. \"She is still a Montrose.\"\n\nWith a look of annoyed patience, Margaret continued:\n\n\"The gossip about her prolonged 'European vacation' has already begun. People are counting months, making calculations. We need to act quickly, or no respectable man will have her at all.\"\n\nThe silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken failure.\n\nFinally, Clarence exhaled through his nose—the closest he came to expressing resignation.\n\n\"Very well. Invite him to dinner. Let us see what sort of man he is.\"\n\nMargaret rose smoothly. \"I'll send the invitation tomorrow.\"\n\nShe swept from the room, leaving her husband alone seething in his disappointment."

      "content": "<i>I saw her today. I REALLY saw her.\n\nShe was in the Montrose garden among the roses, her dress the pale blush of tea roses, flowing in the afternoon breeze. She moved through the rosebushes like she herself was a rose—inevitable, perfect, meant to be.\n\nAll these years of theoretical work—this MEANS something. This is what it was all for.\n\nI spoke to Dr. Hartley at the university yesterday about the formula. Hartley knows his botanical work exceptionally well, though he has the peculiar quality of discussing ancient poisons with the same enthusiastic precision he brings to medicinal herbs. Frankie occasionally consults him about rare botanicals imported through Harbor Imports—if Hartley notices anything unusual about the nature of these consultations, he shows no signs of it. Odd fellow. Sometimes he gets that distant look in his eyes, as if his mind has wandered to some faraway place. Perhaps, the man simply loves his plants, whether they heal or harm.\n\nHe confirmed my base ingredients are sound—the damiana for desire and warmth, the valerian for calm and trust, the rose otto for transcendence. But I asked him specifically about Panax ginseng, the true Oriental variety.\n\nHartley, in his typical thorough manner, explained its three-thousand-year history in Chinese medicine. The root is prized not merely as a tonic for vitality, but as a symbol of lasting union in traditional wedding preparations. The Chinese believe it enhances what they call \"qi\"—the vital force—but more importantly, it represents permanence, endurance, and the binding of souls.\n\nThat's when I understood.\n\nThe ginseng root isn't just another botanical—it's the binding agent I've been searching for. Not to create passion, which is fleeting, but to suggest commitment at the deepest level. To transform attraction into devotion.\n\nJust a small amount. Five grains of the aged Korean root, dissolved with the other botanicals. Enough to whisper \"forever\" into the formula.\n\nThe missing piece has been found.</i>"

      "title": "A Dangerous Conversation",
      "content": "Sebastian Crane approached the familiar docks at the port of Long Beach with a sense of dread coiling in his gut. His relationship with Cordelia was evolving into something deeper—something real—and soon he planned on proposing. But he couldn't allow his dirty dealings with Frankie \"The Coast\" Romano to interfere with those plans.\n\nSure, he and Frankie had made a killing providing bootleg booze to the speakeasies up and down the coast, but it was time to end it. He'd made a significant fortune, and his investments were performing well. He no longer needed to get his hands dirty. The pharmacy, the bootleg business—it was time to leave it all behind.\n\nBut Frankie wouldn't like that. Still, Sebastian was certain he'd accept it eventually. They were reasonable men, after all.\n\nThe salt air hung heavy as Sebastian reached the weathered planks of the dock. Frankie was waiting as expected, a dark silhouette against the fading light, cigarette glowing between his fingers. Sebastian glanced around—it was a quiet evening, no one in sight, but you never knew who might be listening in this business.\n\n\"Frankie, we gotta talk. I can't be doing this anymore.\"\n\nFrankie's eyes narrowed. \"Whaddya mean you can't? We just started rakin' it in!\"\n\n\"I know, but these high society types—the Montrose family—they got their noses in everything. They're gonna find out about you and me, and then—\"\n\n\"High society?\" Frankie took a step closer, his voice rising. \"I stuck my NECK out for you! Told the boys you was good for it!\"\n\n\"And we made money, didn't we? Real good money. I'll square up whatever you want—\"\n\n\"You SWORE this would be the biggest take we ever seen!\" Frankie's voice carried across the water now, and a few dock workers turned to look. \"Said we'd be set for life! And now that the dough's finally rollin' in, you wanna beat it and play Mr. Respectable?\"\n\n\"Keep it down, will ya—\"\n\n\"You think you're some kind of big shot now? Too good for the likes of me?\" Frankie jabbed a finger into Sebastian's chest. \"You gave your WORD, Sebastian!\"\n\nSebastian held up his hands, trying to placate him. \"I'll get you someone else, someone just as good who can—\"\n\n\"So that's it?\" Frankie was shouting now, his face flushed with rage. \"You USE me to get started, and soon as you got what you need, you're gonna blow? That ain't how this game works, pal!\"\n\n\"Frankie, please, just listen—\"\n\n\"You don't just WALK AWAY from Frankie Romano. Not from this. Not from ME.\" He stepped closer, his voice dropping to something more dangerous than a shout. \"We had a DEAL.\"\n\nFrankie shoved Sebastian hard. Sebastian stumbled backward, his heel catching on an uneven plank. He caught himself against a piling, then turned and hurried off the docks, Frankie's furious stare burning into his back.\n\nAs he reached solid ground, Sebastian realized with a sinking feeling that this wasn't over. Not by a long shot."

      "title": "The Pocket Watch",
      "content": "Sebastian paced the neat drawing room of his recently purchased house on Ocean Boulevard, his thoughts settling pleasantly on his recent engagement to Cordelia Montrose.\n\nThe Montroses had been cold and disapproving at first—naturally, a pharmacist wasn't their ideal choice. But once they'd learned more about Sebastian's standing in the community, and more importantly, his not insignificant fortune (of somewhat dubious origins, perhaps, but quite substantial nonetheless), they'd stopped asking uncomfortable questions. Mr. Montrose had even consulted him recently about strategic investments in pharmaceutical companies. How quickly attitudes shifted when money entered the equation!\n\nThe postman's knock interrupted his pleasant reverie. Sebastian retrieved the letter from the hall table—his brother's handwriting on the envelope, neat and precise as always.\n\nInside was a congratulatory card and something wrapped in velvet. He unfolded the letter and read:\n\n<i>My Dear Brother,\n\nI present to you this timepiece on the occasion of your engagement to Miss Montrose. It marks not merely the hours and minutes of our earthly existence, but something far more significant.\n\nInside, I have engraved the date of September's astronomical event you spoke of—the conjunction of Jupiter and Venus, a celestial alignment that occurs but once in a generation. The timing of your engagement and upcoming wedding is very fortunate indeed. The ancients believed such moments carried profound significance, marking the intersection of love and fortune.\n\nI thought it fitting that you should carry with you a record of this sacred timing. Let it remind you that some moments in life are written in the stars themselves.\n\nMay your union be as harmonious as the heavens above.\n\nYour devoted brother, Thaddeus</i>\n\nSebastian unwrapped the velvet carefully. Inside was a pocket watch—simple, without unnecessary ornamentation, yet elegant in its restraint. Bronze casing, substantial weight, the kind of timepiece a serious man would carry. He opened it.\n\nThe date was engraved inside with exquisite precision, surrounded by the symbols of the planets arranged around a central sun. The celestial diagram was beautifully rendered, almost mystical.\n\nHis brother truly understood him.\n\nSebastian closed the watch with a satisfying click and slipped it into his waistcoat pocket, feeling its comforting weight against his chest. What a fortunate thing, to have a brother like Thaddeus. Since childhood, Thaddeus had always encouraged Sebastian's chemical experiments and pharmaceutical pursuits, even when their parents had been skeptical—even alarmed.\n\nEverything was falling into place exactly as it should."
