      "content": "The letter arrived on a Tuesday morning, embossed with the seal of a generational wealth management firm.\n\n\"Miss Montrose,\n\nWe are writing to inform you that you are the heir to the Montrose family estate located at 266 Kennebec Avenue, Long Beach, California. The property has been held in trust for several decades, and our records indicate you are the closest living relative with a legal claim...\"\n\nThe Heiress—tired of her overbearing family, hungry for independence—saw opportunity. A mansion of her own? In Long Beach? How glamorous. How perfect. How bad could it be?\n\nThe Fiduciary who tracked her down was thorough, pedantic, obsessed with proper documentation. They'd been managing the Montrose, Crane, and Whitmore estates for years. The mansion had been an eyesore, a wasted asset, abandoned for decades. If they could get someone to finally claim it, perhaps they could close this particular chapter of frustration.\n\nSo the Heiress moved in, expecting elegance and independence.\n\nShe discovered, instead, that she was not alone."
