      "content": "The Baker stood before the Montrose mansion, holding a basket wrapped in linen cloth, still uncertain why he had driven here.\n\nThis morning, flour had been on his hands as always. He'd been measuring rose petals for the morning batch—a routine performed a thousand times. Rosebuds gathered at dawn, dried in glass jars, the precise measurements from the recipe he'd carried his whole life.\n\nThat recipe was his only inheritance.\n\nWhen someone left him as an infant on the steps of St. Mary's Church, the recipe had been tucked beneath the blankets—pressed inside a worn leather journal belonging to someone named Eleanor. The journal also contained a faded black-and-white photograph of a striking young woman with large brown eyes and long dark hair, standing in a garden surrounded by roses.\n\nNo note. No explanation. Just the journal, the photograph, and a recipe for rose bread.\n\nThe Baker had been kneading dough this morning when Grandmother's invitation arrived. An investigation at the Montrose mansion. A century-old mystery to be solved. Your presence is requested.\n\nHe should have thrown it away. He had orders to fill, customers waiting, the rhythm of his daily work calling him.\n\nBut something had pulled at him. A knowing. The same intuition that told him when a customer needed honey instead of sugar in their tea, when someone was carrying grief too heavy for words, when a loaf needed five more minutes even though the timer said it was done. People called it empathy. His old therapist had called it hypervigilance—a survival mechanism from an uncertain childhood.\n\nBut the Baker knew what it really was: he sensed things. Saw connections others missed. The world spoke to him in whispers and gut feelings he'd learned long ago to trust.\n\nSo he wrapped the rose bread in cloth—the same recipe from Eleanor's journal, the one he'd perfected over years—got in his car, and drove to this mansion without quite understanding why."

      "content": "The Influencer practically vibrated with energy when he saw the Baker, phone already raised, eyes alight with that particular hunger content creators get when they spot a story.\n\n\"Oh, you brought food!\" he said, and the Baker could see him calculating angles, trying to figure out how to frame the basket for maximum appeal. \"You're the baker, right? From that place downtown?\"\n\n\"Sweet Rose Bakery,\" the Baker confirmed, offering the basket. \"I brought rose bread. It's—\"\n\n\"Oh my God, yes! Rose bread!\" The Influencer took a piece, his expression shifting from performance to genuine appreciation. \"This is incredible. You know, there's this whole crazy story about a bakery that burned down in the 1990s? It was supposed to be famous for rose bread. The fire was never really explained—some people think arson, others think it was insurance fraud, but the family died in it. Parents and grandparents, I think? Super tragic.\"\n\nThe Baker's hands went still. Rose bread. Bakery fire. He needed to know more.\n\n\"Oh, here,\" the Influencer said, already scrolling on his phone. \"I have a link.\"\n\n<strong><i><u>November 5, 1990, Long Beach Gazette</u></i></strong>\n\n<strong><i>DEVASTATING BLAZE DESTROYS SULLIVAN BAKERY\n\nBeloved Long Beach Institution Lost to Suspicious Fire\n\nSULLIVAN'S BAKERY, a Long Beach institution for over sixty years, burned to the ground late last night in a fire that left two dead and raised troubling questions about the blaze's origin. The bodies have been identified as David Sullivan, 38, owner of the bakery, and Catherine Sullivan, 36, his wife. Reports state the Sullivans had an infant child, though no body has been recovered despite extensive searches of the ruins.\n\nFire Marshal David Chen stated: \"The fire spread with unusual rapidity. The preliminary finding is electrical wiring failure.\"\n\nAccelerant patterns were noted by responding firefighters, and one neighbor reported seeing an unidentified figure fleeing the building in the darkness.\n\nSullivan's Bakery had operated continuously since 1927, founded by Eleanor Sullivan and famous for the family's rose bread recipe passed down through generations. The timing is notable: this fire occurs just as new interest in the 1925 Montrose mystery has surfaced. The official investigation concludes electrical failure, yet questions linger about the accelerant evidence and the Sullivan family connection to those historical events.</i></strong>\n\nThe Baker looked up from his phone, his face drained of color.\n\nEleanor Sullivan. She'd founded the bakery. The original rose bread bakery.\n\nIt was her diary he'd been carrying his whole life. Her recipe he'd been baking every morning. Her photograph he kept tucked in his kitchen—the woman with the large brown eyes standing in a garden of roses. Was that her?\n\nAnd the baby's body was never recovered from the fire.\n\nHis thoughts raced, connections forming like bread dough coming together—separate ingredients suddenly becoming something whole.\n\nWho am I?\n\nAnd more urgently: Who set that fire?\n\nHe thought he knew the diary's contents by heart by now—had read Eleanor's words so many times the pages were worn soft as fabric. He'd connected with her longing, her not knowing where she came from, who her real mother was. The ache of being given away.\n\nHe'd thought he understood those feelings because he shared them.\n\nBut now he needed to read it again. Be sure. See what he might have missed."

Inside were photographs—a woman with dark hair and sad eyes, beautiful in a way that made my chest ache.\n\n'This is your birth mother,' Mother explained. 'She loved you very much. She wasn't able to raise you, but she wanted you to know what she looked like. To know she hadn't forgotten.'\n\nFather looked uncomfortable. He left the room.\n\nI stared at the photograph for hours. The woman looked lonely.\n\nI also saw a letter addressed to me, in a handwriting I didn't recognize. I opened it. Inside was a recipe.\n\nRose bread.\n\nThe note read: 'From a friend of your mother's. She wanted you to have this. It was her favorite!' I will make this recipe. It's my only connection to her.</i>"

      "content": "<i>Today I stood in the bakery kneading dough, and Mother complimented my technique. 'You have a gift for this,' she said. 'It's in your blood.'\n\nAnd I thought: which blood? The Sullivan blood, from the people who raised me? Or the blood of my birth mother?\n\nMother taught me bread-making when I could barely reach the counter. This is the legacy I've been given.\n\nBut the rose bread is different. When I bake the rose bread, I feel connected to something. To someone. I taste love in every loaf.\n\nI wonder if that was intentional. I wonder if my mother knew that someday her daughter would bake this bread and understand, somehow, what it meant.\n\nI think of her every time my hands shape the dough.</i>"
