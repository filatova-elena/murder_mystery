      "content": "The Professor made his way through the overgrown grounds of the mansion, examining the botanical specimens with professional interest. A patch of colorful ornamental peppers. An ancient rose garden, still blooming despite decades of neglect. And then—tucked behind a tangle of jasmine vines—a small outbuilding.\n\nThe door opened with a rusty creak.\n\nThe Professor stepped inside and stopped, his pulse quickening with recognition.\n\nA laboratory. Abandoned for a century, but unmistakably a laboratory.\n\nWorkbenches lined the walls, covered in dust and cobwebs. Glass bottles and amber jars stood in neat rows, their contents long dried or evaporated. A brass balance scale sat in the corner. Bunsen burners. Distillation equipment. This had been a serious workspace.\n\nThe Professor moved from jar to jar, reading faded labels, opening stoppers to smell the contents.\n\n<strong>Rose otto</strong>. The Professor inhaled deeply. That characteristic floral intensity, even after all these years.\n\n<strong>Damiana</strong>. Unmistakable. The dried leaves still held their distinctive scent.\n\nHe picked up another jar and examined the gnarled root inside. <strong>Ginseng</strong>. Korean, if he weren't mistaken. Incredibly rare and expensive in the 1920s.\n\n<strong>Valerian root</strong>. The Professor recognized its sharp, almost unpleasant medicinal smell.\n\nAnd over here—<strong>vanilla extract</strong>, <strong>honey</strong>, <strong>cherry syrup</strong>. Flavorings.\n\n\"Someone was making a tonic,\" the Professor murmured. \"These were popular in the 1920s. Sold as cure-alls, tonics for vigor and vitality.\"\n\nThen he spotted the large glass carboys in the corner, still half-full of clear liquid.\n\n<strong>Grain alcohol</strong>.\n\nThe Professor's eyebrows rose. \"During Prohibition. This much would have required serious connections.\" He examined the setup more carefully. \"Unless... yes. Under the medicinal tonic cover. These were legal for pharmaceutical use.\"\n\nOn the main workbench, the Professor found scattered papers—some torn, some water-stained, but remarkably preserved in the dry shed. Notes in cramped handwriting. Calculations. Crossed-out formulas.\n\nHe picked up a page at random and read:\n\n<strong><i>First principles: What is love but chemistry? The ancients understood—Venus and desire, the movement of blood...</i></strong>\n\n\"A poet chemist?\" the Professor muttered. \"Curious.\"\n\nMore pages revealed obsessive refinements of a formula. Ratios adjusted. Ingredients added and crossed out. The handwriting grew more frantic in later entries.\n\nThen the Professor found it—a final page, more elaborate than the others. At the top, carefully drawn symbols: planets, constellations, astrological signs arranged in a specific pattern. It looked ritualistic. Almost ominous.\n\nBelow the symbols, written in clear, confident script: ..."

      "content": "Dr. Sinclair entered the dusty laboratory, her medical bag in hand. She'd been examining the house's old medicine cabinet when the Professor summoned her.\n\n\"What do you make of this?\" The Professor handed over the formula.\n\nDr. Sinclair read it carefully, her expression growing more serious with each line. \"Someone was making a love potion. An 'Elixir of Eternal Love.'\" She looked up. \"Given that Sebastian Crane died of suspected poisoning, this is... troubling.\"\n\n\"But look at the ingredients,\" the Professor said. \"I've examined every botanical component. They're all completely harmless. Common tonic ingredients, actually. What's your medical opinion on the chemical compounds?\"\n\nDr. Sinclair studied the formula again. \"<strong>Potassium bromide</strong> was used as a sedative—perfectly legal in the 1920s. <strong>Calcium lactate</strong> for fortification. <strong>Iron citrate</strong> as a blood tonic. All standard medicinal ingredients.\" She frowned. \"Individually, none of these would be toxic. Even in combination, at these dosages... I don't see how this could kill anyone.\"\n\n\"So it's safe?\"\n\n\"In theory.\" Dr. Sinclair's frown deepened. \"But Professor, could any of these botanicals become toxic when combined? Some plants have strange interactions.\"\n\nThe Professor considered this carefully. He picked up the jar of <strong>ginseng</strong>, examining it in the dim light. \"In my professional opinion? No. These botanicals don't interact dangerously. <strong>Valerian</strong> might enhance the sedative effect of the <strong>bromide</strong> slightly, but not lethally.\"\n\n\"Then this formula is harmless?\"\n\n\"This formula, yes.\" The Professor set down the jar and met Dr. Sinclair's eyes. \"But perhaps this isn't the final formula. Perhaps there was another version. Something more... potent.\"\n\nThey both looked around the laboratory—at the rows of jars, the scattered papers, the evidence of obsessive experimentation.\n\nSomewhere in this room might be the real answer. The formula that had killed Sebastian Crane. And possibly others.\n\nDr. Sinclair pulled out her phone. \"We need to tell Grandmother about this. And we need to find out if there are more formulas hidden here.\"\n\nThe Professor nodded, already moving toward the other shelves, other papers."
