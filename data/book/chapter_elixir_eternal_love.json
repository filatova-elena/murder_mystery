      "content": "The Professor made their way through the overgrown grounds of the mansion, examining the botanical specimens with professional interest. A patch of colorful ornamental peppers. An ancient rose garden, still blooming despite decades of neglect. And then—tucked behind a tangle of jasmine vines—a small outbuilding.\n\nThe door opened with a rusty creak.\n\nThe Professor stepped inside and stopped, their pulse quickening with recognition.\n\nA laboratory. Abandoned for a century, but unmistakably a laboratory.\n\nWorkbenches lined the walls, covered in dust and cobwebs. Glass bottles and amber jars stood in neat rows, their contents long dried or evaporated. A brass balance scale sat in the corner. Bunsen burners. Distillation equipment. This had been a serious workspace.\n\nThe Professor moved from jar to jar, reading faded labels, opening stoppers to smell the contents.\n\nRose otto. The Professor inhaled deeply. That characteristic floral intensity, even after all these years.\n\nDamiana. Unmistakable. The dried leaves still held their distinctive scent.\n\nThey picked up another jar and examined the gnarled root inside. Ginseng. Korean, if they weren't mistaken. Incredibly rare and expensive in the 1920s.\n\nValerian root. The Professor recognized its sharp, almost unpleasant medicinal smell.\n\nAnd over here—vanilla extract, honey, cherry syrup. Flavorings.\n\n\"Someone was making a tonic,\" the Professor murmured. \"These were popular in the 1920s. Sold as cure-alls, tonics for vigor and vitality.\"\n\nThen they spotted the large glass carboys in the corner, still half-full of clear liquid.\n\nGrain alcohol.\n\nThe Professor's eyebrows rose. \"During Prohibition. This much would have required serious connections.\" They examined the setup more carefully. \"Unless... yes. Under the medicinal tonic cover. These were legal for pharmaceutical use.\"\n\nOn the main workbench, the Professor found scattered papers—some torn, some water-stained, but remarkably preserved in the dry shed. Notes in cramped handwriting. Calculations. Crossed-out formulas.\n\nThey picked up a page at random and read:\n\n\"First principles: What is love but chemistry? The ancients understood—Venus and desire, the movement of blood...\"\n\n\"A poet chemist?\" the Professor muttered. \"Curious.\"\n\nMore pages revealed obsessive refinements of a formula. Ratios adjusted. Ingredients added and crossed out. The handwriting grew more frantic in later entries.\n\nThen the Professor found it—a final page, more elaborate than the others. At the top, carefully drawn symbols: planets, constellations, astrological signs arranged in a specific pattern. It looked ritualistic. Almost ominous.\n\nBelow the symbols, written in clear, confident script:\n\n<strong>ELIXIR OF ETERNAL LOVE - Final Formula (September 1925)</strong>\n\n<strong>Botanical Components:</strong>\n\nDamiana (3 parts) - for desire, heat, and awakening\n\nValerian Root (2 parts) - for calm, trust, and grounding\n\nRose Otto (1 drop only) - pure essential oil for transcendence and romantic intention\n\nGinseng Root (smallest pinch) - binding agent for eternal love and longevity\n\n<strong>Chemical Components:</strong>\n\nPotassium Bromide (10 grains) - mild sedative, for peace of mind\n\nCalcium Lactate (5 grains) - fortifying agent for strength\n\nIron Citrate (3 grains) - blood tonic for vitality\n\n<strong>Base & Preservative:</strong>\n\nGrain Alcohol (8 oz at 95% proof) - carrier and preservative\n\n<strong>Flavorings & Sweeteners:</strong>\n\nVanilla Extract (2 tsp)\n\nCherry Syrup (1 oz)\n\nHoney (to taste)\n\nTo be administered daily. The binding takes time. Patience is essential.\n\nThe Professor stared at the formula, their mind racing.\n\n\"Dr. Sinclair!\" they called. \"You need to see this.\""

      "content": "A Few Minutes Later\n\nDr. Sinclair entered the dusty laboratory, their medical bag in hand. They'd been examining the house's old medicine cabinet when the Professor summoned them.\n\n\"What do you make of this?\" The Professor handed over the formula.\n\nDr. Sinclair read it carefully, their expression growing more serious with each line. \"Someone was making a love potion. An 'Elixir of Eternal Love.'\" They looked up. \"Given that Sebastian Crane died of suspected poisoning, this is... troubling.\"\n\n\"But look at the ingredients,\" the Professor said. \"I've examined every botanical component. They're all completely harmless. Common tonic ingredients, actually. What's your medical opinion on the chemical compounds?\"\n\nDr. Sinclair studied the formula again. \"Potassium bromide was used as a sedative—perfectly legal in the 1920s. Calcium lactate for fortification. Iron citrate as a blood tonic. All standard medicinal ingredients.\" They frowned. \"Individually, none of these would be toxic. Even in combination, at these dosages... I don't see how this could kill anyone.\"\n\n\"So it's safe?\"\n\n\"In theory.\" Dr. Sinclair's frown deepened. \"But Professor, could any of these botanicals become toxic when combined? Some plants have strange interactions.\"\n\nThe Professor considered this carefully. They picked up the jar of ginseng, examining it in the dim light. \"In my professional opinion? No. These botanicals don't interact dangerously. Valerian might enhance the sedative effect of the bromide slightly, but not lethally.\"\n\n\"Then this formula is harmless?\"\n\n\"This formula, yes.\" The Professor set down the jar and met Dr. Sinclair's eyes. \"But perhaps this isn't the final formula. Perhaps there was another version. Something more... potent.\"\n\nThey both looked around the laboratory—at the rows of jars, the scattered papers, the evidence of obsessive experimentation.\n\nSomewhere in this room might be the real answer. The formula that had killed Sebastian Crane. And possibly others.\n\nDr. Sinclair pulled out their phone. \"We need to tell Grandmother about this. And we need to find out if there are more formulas hidden here.\"\n\nThe Professor nodded, already moving toward the other shelves, other papers.\n\nThe hunt was on."
