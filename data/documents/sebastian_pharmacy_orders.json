    "character_interpretations": {
      "professor": "The foxglove purchases are peculiar. Sebastian never consulted me about including foxglove in his formulation. I approved only the harmless botanicals. Why would he purchase it on August 12th? And why order more on September 1st? The notation about 'Dr. T. requested' is suspiciousâ€”why would Thaddeus be ordering through his brother's account?",
      "doctor": "These records prove Thaddeus had access to foxglove through Sebastian's pharmacy account. The handwritten notation 'Dr. T. requested' shows deliberate subterfuge. He used his brother's legitimate business to procure the poison.",
      "fiduciary": "The dates are critical. Foxglove purchased August 12. Elixir ritual begins September 4. Additional foxglove ordered September 1, just days before poisoning timeline begins. Financial records show premeditation.",
      "mortician": "The quantities are damning. 4 ounces August 12, then 2 ounces September 1. For someone claiming to only be consulting, Thaddeus certainly needed a lot of foxglove for 'cardiac patients.'"
