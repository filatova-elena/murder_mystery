    "character_interpretations": {
      "professor": "The foxglove purchases are unusual. According to my ancestor's consultation records, Sebastian never discussed including foxglove in his approved formulation. Yet here he is purchasing large quantities on August 12th and ordering more on September 1st. The purchasing pattern is noteworthy.",
      "doctor": "These records are evidence. Foxglove appears multiple times across the ordersâ€”large quantities in August, then again in September. Multiple orders suggest significant need or experimentation.",
      "fiduciary": "The dates are notable. Foxglove purchased August 12 and again September 1. Large quantities for pharmaceutical purposes. The pattern of repeat orders in a short timeframe is interesting from a business perspective.",
      "mortician": "The quantities are significant. 4 ounces in August, then 2 ounces in September. For a pharmacist, this suggests active compounding work or experimentation with the botanical."
