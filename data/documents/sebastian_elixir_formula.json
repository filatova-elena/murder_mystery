The botanical components are legitimate and properly sourced. Someone understood traditional herbal methods combined with modern pharmaceutical science. The problem was not the formula itself, but its execution.'\n\nDoctor: 'Every ingredient is individually safe in the quantities prescribed. Potassium bromide, calcium lactate, iron citrate—all standard 1920s pharmaceuticals. But storage conditions, contamination, or concentration errors could have made them dangerous. Someone failed to verify basic pharmaceutical safety protocols.'\n\nArt Collector: 'The sourcing through Harbor Import & Trading shows sophisticated taste. Every ingredient represents the finest available—genuine rose otto, premium ginseng, quality spirits. Someone spent significant money to create something exquisite.'\n\nExplorer: 'The systematic approach shows deliberate planning. Each ingredient was researched and sourced carefully. The quantities follow mathematical precision. Someone spent months or years perfecting this formula.'\n\nFiduciary: 'From a financial standpoint, this represents considerable expense. Premium botanicals, pharmaceutical compounds, quality spirits, and precious oils. Someone with resources and intention created this formula.'\n\nBaker: 'The flavorings show someone who understood taste balance. The vanilla, cherry, and honey would completely mask the bitter botanicals. Someone knew how to make something taste delicious while hiding its true nature.'"
