    "headline": "DEVASTATING BLAZE DESTROYS SULLIVAN BAKERY - Beloved Long Beach Institution Lost to Suspicious Fire",
    "content": "SULLIVAN'S BAKERY, a Long Beach institution for over sixty years, burned to the ground late last night in a fire that left two dead and raised troubling questions about the blaze's origin. The bodies have been identified as David Sullivan, 38, owner of the bakery, and Catherine Sullivan, 36, his wife. Reports state the Sullivans had an infant child, though no body has been recovered despite extensive searches of the ruins. Fire Marshal David Chen stated: \"The fire spread with unusual rapidity. The preliminary finding is electrical wiring failure.\"\n\nAccelerant patterns were noted by responding firefighters, and one neighbor reported seeing an unidentified figure fleeing the building in the darkness. Sullivan's Bakery had operated continuously since 1927, founded by Eleanor Sullivan and famous for the family's rose bread recipe passed down through generations. The timing is notable: this fire occurs just as new interest in the 1925 Montrose mystery has surfaced. The official investigation concludes electrical failure, yet questions linger about the accelerant evidence and the Sullivan family connection to those historical events.",
    "reveals": "A fire in 1990 that destroyed Sullivan's Bakery, killing David and Catherine Sullivan. Reports state the Sullivans had an infant child, though no body was recovered. The timing is suspicious—occurring as new investigations into the 1925 deaths began. Official cause: electrical fire, but accelerant evidence and witness reports suggest possible arson.",
    "character_interpretations": {
      "baker": "The bakery was founded by Eleanor Sullivan... that's the name from my diary. And this bakery is famous for their rose bread recipe—the same recipe I've been baking my whole life, passed down in Eleanor's diary.",
      "fiduciary": "The timing is remarkable—this fire occurred just as new investigations into the 1925 mysteries began. Convenient timing. The Montrose family has been quiet about this incident.",
      "heiress": "My family's property—or was it? The bakery burned in 1990. David and Catherine Sullivan dead. The Sullivan family was connected to our family somehow—I've seen references in old papers. Was this fire part of our family's old business?",
      "explorer": "The Sullivan family connection to the 1925 deaths is documented. This fire occurs precisely when that mystery is being revisited. Either remarkable coincidence, or someone is eliminating witnesses.",
      "professor": "The timing is notable: the fire occurs in 1990, nearly 65 years after the 1925 deaths, at precisely the moment renewed interest in those historical events has surfaced. This suggests either deliberate destruction of evidence or remarkable coincidence.",
      "psychic": "Two souls lost in flame. But there's another presence I sense—the third soul who should have perished but didn't.",
      "clockmaker": "This fire occurs when investigations into the 1925 mystery begin. Strange.",
      "dressmaker": "Eleanor Sullivan founded the bakery. The rose bread recipe—I've heard that Eleanor made it in the 1920s. Is this the same family line?",
      "influencer": "The timing! It happened right when people started digging into the 1925 deaths again. This is the kind of mystery that makes for absolutely riveting content—murder, family secrets, cover-ups spanning generations!",
      "mortician": "Without seeing the actual autopsy reports, I can't comment on cause of death. The article mentions an infant child whose body was never recovered.",
      "doctor": "Without seeing the actual medical examination records, I can't evaluate the discrepancy between accelerant evidence and the official ruling. The missing infant child is concerning."
