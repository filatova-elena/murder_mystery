  "character_interpretations": {
    "art_collector": "Looking at these manifests, I see the pattern immediately. In every shipment, legitimate art items—marble busts ($2,400), oil paintings ($3,200), sculpture ($2,900)—are mixed with entries like 'private delivery, contents unlisted' ($8,500-$20,000). The art is documented in detail. The valuable items aren't. That's intentional. Someone knew exactly what they were doing.",
    "professor": "These manifests show a common pattern in shipping records from this era. Legitimate goods clearly documented—Italian marble, English paintings, French wine—but interspersed with mysterious entries: 'private delivery,' 'special arrangement,' 'contents unlisted.' In international trade, especially during this period, those coded entries typically mean goods that bypassed standard inspection. The values are substantial enough that someone wanted them moved without scrutiny.",
    "clockmaker": "The costs are revealing. Look at the individual items: marble busts $2,400, paintings $3,200, wine $1,200. Reasonable. But then 'private delivery, contents unlisted' is listed at $8,500, $15,000, $18,500—often double or triple the legitimate items. And notice: every single manifest includes at least one 'coded' entry. That's not random. That's systematic. Someone calculated this precisely.",
    "fiduciary": "From a financial perspective, these manifests tell a clear story. The documented items—art, books, textiles—are recorded with item descriptions and reasonable valuations. But the 'private delivery' and 'special arrangement' entries have no description yet carry substantial values: $8,500, $12,000, $15,000, $20,000. By 1966, these undescribed shipments represent significant assets. Everything is recorded for apparent legitimacy, nothing is recorded for actual transparency.",
    "explorer": "The escalation over time is notable. Compare 1945 to 1966. Early manifests have mostly legitimate items with occasional 'private delivery' entries. By 1966, nearly half of each manifest is coded entries. Someone was systematically increasing their volume of undocumented shipments. That suggests either growing business, or deliberate acceleration of asset movement."
