    "art_collector": "Looking at these manifests, I can see precisely what was happening. The legitimately documented pieces—marble busts ($2,400), oil paintings ($3,200), French sculpture ($2,900)—those are competent acquisitions, certainly. Fine pieces. But notice the pattern. Every single manifest includes items marked 'private delivery, contents unlisted' at substantially higher valuations. $8,500, $15,000, $18,500. Someone understood the art world well enough to use legitimate art as camouflage. The documented pieces give the manifests an air of legitimacy. The undocumented ones are where the real operation existed.",
    "professor": "These manifests demonstrate a classic pattern from international shipping records of this era. Legitimate goods clearly itemized—Italian marble, English paintings, French wine—interspersed with coded entries: 'private delivery,' 'special arrangement,' 'contents unlisted.' In trade during the 1940s-60s, such entries typically indicated cargo that circumvented standard customs inspection. The valuations are substantial enough that someone went to considerable effort to move these goods without scrutiny.",
    "clockmaker": "The numerical precision here is striking. Look closely: Italian marble $2,400, paintings $3,200, wine $1,200. Standard items. But then 'private delivery, contents unlisted' appears at $8,500, $15,000, $18,500—often double or triple the legitimate items. And here's what fascinates me: every single manifest includes at least one coded entry. Not occasionally. Not sometimes. Every one. That's not luck or coincidence. That's systematic calculation. Someone planned this with meticulous precision.",
    "fiduciary": "From a financial standpoint, this is remarkably transparent. The documented items—art, books, textiles—are recorded with explicit descriptions and reasonable valuations. But the 'private delivery' and 'special arrangement' entries are entirely undescribed yet carry substantial values: $8,500, $12,000, $15,000, $20,000. By 1966, these undescribed shipments represent a significant portion of total assets. Everything is recorded for apparent legitimacy. Nothing is recorded for actual transparency. It's a masterclass in documentation without disclosure.",
    "dressmaker": "Oh, I wonder what kind of textiles they imported! Look at these entries—'textile imports, fine linens' in 1945, 'textiles and furnishings' in 1958, 'marble and stone' in 1966. As someone who works with fabrics every day, I'm curious about these shipments. What grades of linen? What finishes? Were they acquiring for collection, or for business? The entries are so vague. And mixed in with all these items—textiles listed alongside those mysterious 'private delivery' entries. I wonder if anyone actually examined what came off those ships.",
    "heiress": "Looking at this, I see all the fancy things—marble busts, oil paintings, French sculpture, crystal glassware from Amsterdam. These are the kinds of pieces that should have graced grand mansions, right? Beautiful things. Precious things. Documented quite carefully. But then alongside them, these cryptic entries: 'private delivery,' 'special arrangement'—things worth just as much, sometimes more, but with no description at all. It's almost like someone was bringing in hidden treasures to the mansion alongside the legitimate pieces. How very mysterious. How perfectly fitting for a house like mine.",
    "explorer": "The escalation over time is what stands out. Compare the early manifests from 1945 to the later ones from 1966. In 1945, you see mostly legitimate items—marble, paintings, tea, wine. The 'private delivery' entries are there, but sparse. By 1966, nearly half of every manifest is coded entries. Someone was systematically increasing their volume of undocumented shipments. That suggests either a growing operation that required faster asset movement, or deliberate acceleration to move materials before some anticipated problem. The pattern is unmistakable."
