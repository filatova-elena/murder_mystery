  "character_interpretations": {
    "art_collector": "I know these manifests. They're in the family archives. The pattern is obvious to anyone who knows the business—legitimate imports mixed with items marked 'private delivery' or 'special arrangement.' That's how my ancestors operated. The documented items are real, the coded ones... well, those are what actually mattered.",
    "professor": "Harbor Import & Trading brought in legitimate goods, certainly. But the coded entries—'private delivery,' 'special arrangement'—those could hide anything. Botanical specimens, minerals, chemicals. If someone wanted to move something valuable and untraced, these manifests would show it was 'imported' without ever saying what it was.",
    "fiduciary": "These are systematic records. Everything documented, nothing revealed. The mix of legitimate and questionable entries shows calculated business practice. The 'private delivery' items escalate in value and frequency over time. That's either a growing business, or asset movement before liquidation.",
    "explorer": "The pattern shows escalation. In the 1945 manifests, the 'special arrangements' are smaller. By 1966, they're substantial. Someone was scaling up operations, or moving things faster. The frequency and value both increase over time.",
    "clockmaker": "The precision of these records is striking. Every shipment documented, every item listed with value. Even the ones marked 'contents unlisted'—they're recorded with a value. That takes organization. Someone was running a tight operation."
