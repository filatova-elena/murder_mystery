  "character_interpretations": {
    "art_collector": "I know these manifests. They're in the family archives. And I recognize the pattern immediately—coded language mixed with legitimate imports. My ancestors weren't subtle, but they were systematic. 'Special delivery' and 'private transfer' are euphemisms for cargo that bypassed customs inspection. The price discrepancies show where the real value was. Those 'special shipments' were worth multiples of the legitimate goods on the same manifest.",
    "professor": "The manifests show legitimate botanical imports alongside coded entries. If someone ordered Foxglove (Digitalis) for my ancestor Hartley's botanical consultations, Harbor Import & Trading would have documented it on these manifests. But with coded language. 'Special arrangement' could hide the real contents. It's the perfect cover for moving rare botanical materials—legitimate on the surface, concealed in the coded entries.",
    "fiduciary": "These manifests are smoking guns for systematic tax evasion. The 'special delivery' items represent value not declared, not taxed, not traceable. By 1965, when the IRS was investigating, the frequency of coded entries accelerated. They were moving assets as fast as possible before government seizure. Millions of dollars in value documented only in code.",
    "explorer": "The escalation is telling. Few coded entries before 1955, but after 1955 they increase. That's when the IRS investigation started accelerating. The Romanos saw it coming and started systematically moving assets. By 1965, almost every shipment includes coded 'special delivery' items. They were in full asset-protection mode.",
    "clockmaker": "The precision and system here reflect intelligence. These manifests weren't hastily created—they show careful planning and consistent methodology over decades. Someone organized, methodical, deliberate. They knew how to hide things in plain sight, documenting everything while revealing nothing. That takes real skill."
