        "air_date": "2023-01-15",
        "summary": "In October 1925, three people died mysteriously at the Montrose mansion in Long Beach. The official story: Cordelia Montrose died of a broken heart after her new fianc√© Sebastian suddenly passed away. But the timeline doesn't add up. We investigate the theory that something far more sinister was at play. Was it truly grief? Or could there be a darker explanation involving the pharmacist's experimental elixir? Skeptical analysis suggests natural causes, but the evidence is peculiar.",

        "summary": "In 1990, the Sullivan family bakery - a Long Beach institution for generations - burned to the ground under suspicious circumstances. The official investigation ruled it an accident caused by electrical wiring. But locals whisper about a family connection to the 1925 deaths. We examine the fire investigation records, interview fire marshals, and question whether this was truly an accident or if someone wanted to destroy evidence of the family's past.",

When federal authorities seized his assets in the 1960s, they recovered less than half of what he supposedly accumulated. The legend: Frankie hid millions before the feds arrived.
