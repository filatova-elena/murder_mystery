      "title": "Initial Inquiry - The Young Pharmacist",
      "content": "Quite unusual. Sebastian Crane visited today—nephew to old Edmund Crane who donated those specimens for the garden wall in '19. Or was it '18? No matter. He came with botanical ingredients for his fiancée, rather earnest about the whole thing. Damiana, valerian, rose otto, potassium bromide—all harmless enough. I lectured him on storage conditions, perhaps more than necessary. He approved the formulation. Entirely harmless.",
      "character_interpretations": {
        "botanist": "Hartley approved a completely legitimate romantic formula. All ingredients are correctly identified and safe at those concentrations. Sebastian was consulting on a genuine love potion attempt, not a poison.",
        "mortician": "Hartley verified the formula was safe when made. But three people died. Whatever killed them came AFTER this consultation, not from the formula itself.",
        "art_collector": "The Romano family imported exotic botanicals. If Frankie did business with Hartley, he might have known what materials were available. Could there be a connection?",
        "town_doctor": "As a medical professional, I can verify Hartley's assessment. At these concentrations, the formula is completely benign. The problem emerged later.",
        "fiduciary": "Hartley's professional consultation. All legitimate. But the records show someone paid for change—who paid Silas to alter death records, and was it the same person who altered the formula?"

      "title": "Second Consultation - Refinements and Questions",
      "content": "Young Crane returned, asking about mandrake root for 'symbolic value.' I explained it would be entirely inert at his proposed concentrations—merely ritual, no actual effect. He seemed concerned about whether such small amounts could be harmful in any scenario. I assured him repeatedly they could not. Lost track of time explaining the history of romantic botanicals. My assistant Jenkins looked quite pained.",
      "character_interpretations": {
        "botanist": "This is MY ancestor! Hartley was absolutely correct—mandrake at those concentrations is inert. But I need to know: did someone else consult him about using it as a VEHICLE for something else? A way to mask a more potent ingredient?",
        "mortician": "Hartley assured Sebastian that nothing would show up on examination. At those concentrations, testing wouldn't reveal anything. That's actually important—it means the poison was SUBSTITUTED, not added.",
        "dressmaker": "Sebastian was asking about what would and wouldn't be detectable. He was verifying what could be hidden. How much of an evil schemer was he? Or was he being questioned by someone else?",
        "psychic_medium": "Alice's spirit is restless about this moment. She KNEW something was being planned. Her psychic senses were picking up the betrayal before it happened.",
        "explorer": "Harbor Import & Trading Co. trafficked in rare plants. If someone needed exotic botanicals—or rare poisons—they'd know where to get them. Frankie's operations might have provided the actual poison."

      "title": "Third Consultation - The Final Formula",
      "content": "Third visit. Crane presented his final formula with all components properly detailed. I verified each ingredient and concentration—completely sound, all ratios appropriate, no toxic components, no harmful interactions. I assured him his fiancée was fortunate to have someone so thoughtful. He brightened considerably. I did warn him about storage conditions. Multiple times, as I recall.",
      "character_interpretations": {
        "town_doctor": "Hartley's verification is the baseline proof. THIS is what was SUPPOSED to exist. If someone later changed it, this is the original recipe. My medical expertise confirms Hartley was thorough.",
        "mortician": "This is where Hartley signs off. Everything checks out. This is the moment where the ORIGINAL formula is approved. Any deviations after this point were introduced deliberately.",
        "dressmaker": "Hartley told him storage was critical. Temperature, humidity. And Sebastian remembered this. He must have told Cordelia. Did she notice when the formula degraded or changed?",
        "fiduciary": "Hartley's documentation is precise. This creates a legal timeline—a moment when the formula was verified as safe. Anything that happened after is not Hartley's responsibility, but someone else's.",
        "influencer": "I've been researching this. The timing is critical. September 4th was the Jupiter-Venus conjunction. This consultation happened weeks later. Why does timing matter? Because the poison wasn't administered immediately."

      "title": "Unusual Visit - The Brother",
      "content": "Dr. Thaddeus Crane visited asking detailed questions about my consultations with Sebastian. What advice I'd given, which ingredients I'd approved, whether the formula was safe. Very methodical. I confirmed everything was appropriate, the concentrations safe, no hazardous interactions. He seemed disappointed by this answer. He pressed me specifically on whether the mandrake root could possibly produce harmful effects. I assured him it would be entirely inert. Strange fellow.",
      "character_interpretations": {
        "mortician": "Thaddeus was checking whether his poisoning would show up as botanical in origin. He needed to know if mandrake could mask foxglove or if a substitution would be noticeable. Hartley just told him it would be inert—completely invisible.",
        "town_doctor": "My ancestor. And he's checking to make sure the botanical consultation won't implicate him. He's ensuring there's no connection between Hartley's approved formula and whatever he did.",
        "fiduciary": "Payment records show someone paid Silas $500 in October 1925. Was it Thaddeus? This visit shows Thaddeus checking whether the official story will hold—whether the formula will be blamed if he's investigated.",
        "psychic_medium": "Alice's spirit is SCREAMING about this moment. She knew what was happening. She tried to warn people. This is when Thaddeus was calculating how to cover his tracks.",
        "baker": "I sense something terrible about this conversation. Hartley was being manipulated. Dr. Thaddeus was using Hartley's testimony to create plausible deniability."

      "title": "Reflection - News of Tragedy",
      "content": "[Written in different ink, with hesitation marks]\n\nSebastian Crane is dead. His fiancée as well. Cardiac failure, apparently.\n\nMy consultations were purely botanical. The formula I approved was completely safe. I verified this repeatedly. All ingredients appropriate, all concentrations safe. It couldn't have been the formula.\n\nThough I do wonder why the doctor asked such specific questions about the mandrake's safety. As if he was searching for me to confirm something particular.\n\nThe formula was safe. I verified this. Didn't I?",
      "character_interpretations": {
        "mortician": "Hartley has figured it out. He's realizing he was used. The formula was safe—which means something ELSE killed them. Thaddeus substituted an ingredient after Hartley approved it. Hartley's testimony now proves premeditation.",
        "prosecutor": "Hartley's doubts are crucial evidence. He verified the formula was safe. He warned about storage. He confirmed mandrake was inert. He's now beginning to suspect substitution—exactly what happened. This builds the case against Thaddeus.",
        "town_doctor": "My ancestor is guilty. I can see it now. Hartley suspects it. The formula was safe. Thaddeus changed it. I need to decide whether to protect my family or pursue the truth.",
        "fiduciary": "The payment to Silas Blackwell makes sense now. Someone needed the death records altered. Someone needed Hartley's testimony to be the foundation of a false narrative. Thaddeus set this all up.",
        "psychic_medium": "Hartley is starting to see what Alice has been trying to communicate for 100 years. The formula was safe. The poisoning was deliberate. Thaddeus was careful. He used Hartley's expertise against him.",
        "influencer": "This is it. This is the smoking gun. The formula was safe. Hartley verified it. Multiple times. Which means all three deaths—Alice, Sebastian, Cordelia—they weren't natural or accidental. They were orchestrated."
