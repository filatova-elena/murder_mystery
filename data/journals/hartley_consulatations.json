      "title": "Initial Inquiry - The Young Pharmacist",
      "content": "Quite unusual. Sebastian Crane visited today—nephew to old Edmund Crane who donated those specimens for the garden wall in '19. Or was it '18? No matter. He came with botanical ingredients for his fiancée, rather earnest about the whole thing. Damiana, valerian, rose otto, potassium bromide—all harmless enough. I lectured him on storage conditions, perhaps more than necessary. He approved the formulation. Entirely harmless.",
      "character_interpretations": {
        "botanist": "Hartley's consultation records show he approved a completely legitimate romantic formula. All ingredients are correctly identified and safe at those concentrations. Sebastian was genuinely consulting on a harmless love potion attempt.",
        "mortician": "The consultation records are detailed and thorough. Hartley verified the formula was safe. The documentation is professionally done.",
        "art_collector": "The Romano family imported exotic botanicals through legitimate channels. If Hartley consulted on botanical sourcing, he might have documented what materials were available.",
        "town_doctor": "Examining this historical consultation, Hartley's assessment is medically sound. At those concentrations, the formula is completely benign.",
        "fiduciary": "Hartley's professional consultation is documented and legitimate. He verified all ingredients and concentrations carefully."

      "title": "Second Consultation - Refinements and Questions",
      "content": "Young Crane returned, asking about ginseng root for 'symbolic value.' I explained it would be entirely inert at his proposed concentrations—merely ritual, no actual effect. He seemed concerned about whether such small amounts could be harmful in any scenario. I assured him repeatedly they could not. Lost track of time explaining the history of romantic botanicals. My assistant Jenkins looked quite pained.",
      "character_interpretations": {
        "botanist": "Hartley was asked about ginseng root at those concentrations. He explained it would be inert—merely ritual, no actual pharmacological effect. A reasonable consultation about botanical symbolism.",
        "mortician": "The consultation addressed whether small concentrations would be harmful. Hartley assured Sebastian they could not be. He was thorough in his assessment.",
        "dressmaker": "Sebastian was asking about what would and wouldn't be detectable. He was verifying the safety of the ingredients he planned to use.",
        "psychic_medium": "Something significant happened in this consultation. Someone was being very careful about what they were asking.",
        "explorer": "Hartley spent considerable time explaining botanical history and romantic traditions. This was serious consultation, not casual discussion."

      "title": "Third Consultation - The Final Formula",
      "content": "Third visit. Crane presented his final formula with all components properly detailed. I verified each ingredient and concentration—completely sound, all ratios appropriate, no toxic components, no harmful interactions. I assured him his fiancée was fortunate to have someone so thoughtful. He brightened considerably. I did warn him about storage conditions. Multiple times, as I recall.",
      "character_interpretations": {
        "town_doctor": "Hartley's verification is thorough. He checked all ingredients, concentrations, and interactions. The documentation shows careful, methodical work.",
        "mortician": "Hartley's final assessment: everything checks out, all ratios appropriate, no toxic components, no harmful interactions. Professional and complete.",
        "dressmaker": "Hartley warned about storage conditions—temperature, humidity. He emphasized this multiple times. Storage matters for botanical preparations.",
        "fiduciary": "Hartley's documentation is precise. This creates a documented record of what the formula was supposed to be at this point in time.",
        "influencer": "I've been researching this consultation. September 4th was the Jupiter-Venus conjunction—significant astrologically. This consultation happened weeks before that date."

      "title": "Unusual Visit - The Brother",
      "content": "Dr. Thaddeus Crane visited asking detailed questions about my consultations with Sebastian. What advice I'd given, which ingredients I'd approved, whether the formula was safe. Very methodical. I confirmed everything was appropriate, the concentrations safe, no hazardous interactions. He seemed disappointed by this answer. He pressed me specifically on whether the ginseng root could possibly produce harmful effects. I assured him it would be entirely inert. Strange fellow.",
      "character_interpretations": {
        "mortician": "Dr. Thaddeus was asking methodical questions about what would and wouldn't show up on examination at those concentrations. He was verifying the safety.",
        "town_doctor": "My ancestor checked whether the botanical consultation would support his conclusions. He was verifying there were no obvious issues.",
        "fiduciary": "Payment records show financial activity around this period. This visit shows Thaddeus was concerned about the documented formula.",
        "psychic_medium": "Something was happening in this moment in history. A significant conversation with consequences.",
        "baker": "A doctor asking technical questions about botanical safety. Not my area of expertise."

      "title": "Reflection - News of Tragedy",
      "content": "[Written in different ink, with hesitation marks]\n\nSebastian Crane is dead. His fiancée as well. Cardiac failure, apparently.\n\nMy consultations were purely botanical. The formula I approved was completely safe. I verified this repeatedly. All ingredients appropriate, all concentrations safe. It couldn't have been the formula.\n\nThough I do wonder why the doctor asked such specific questions about the mandrake's safety. As if he was searching for me to confirm something particular.\n\nThe formula was safe. I verified this. Didn't I?",
      "character_interpretations": {
        "mortician": "Reading this historical reflection, Hartley is having doubts. He's reconsidering his own conclusions. Something about the aftermath is troubling him.",
        "prosecutor": "Hartley's documented reflections show he verified the formula was safe. He was thorough. His later doubts are worth examining.",
        "town_doctor": "My ancestor is troubled by something. The historical record shows he questioned his own assessment later. What changed his mind?",
        "fiduciary": "The documentation shows Hartley approved the formula as safe. His later uncertainty is noteworthy from a legal standpoint.",
        "psychic_medium": "Hartley is sensing something wrong. He's beginning to question. His intuition is telling him something doesn't match the official narrative.",
        "influencer": "Hartley's documentation of the formula shows it was approved as harmless. His later doubts suggest he learned something that contradicted his initial assessment."
