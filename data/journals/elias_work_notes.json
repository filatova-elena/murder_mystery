      "content": "She turns to roses in the garden light,\nNot knowing I have fallen into night.\nEach word she speaks, I cannot say my own—\nSo beautiful, and yet forever alone.\n\nI tell her of the flowers, nothing more.\nMy heart lies shattered on her garden floor.",

        "dressmaker": "Reading Elias's words, I understand what he never said aloud. 'My heart lies shattered on her garden floor.' He loved her so completely, so hopelessly. Yet Cordelia chose someone else. She chose a man who was poisoning her, so unfair. And Elias—my ancestor—had to watch. Had to see her fade while he remained silent, unable to speak his love. He chose to be the faithful witness instead."

      "title": "Measurements - Wedding Dress (Cordelia Montrose)",
      "content": "Bust: 34 inches\nWaist: 24 inches\nLength: 62 inches from shoulder\nShoulders: narrow, elegant\nNote: She is smaller than she appears. Delicate frame. Handle with care during fittings.\n\nFabric: French lace and ivory silk\nDesign: High neckline, long sleeves, train\nSpecial request: Include a pocket (she laughed when she asked—said she might need somewhere to hide)\n\nCompletion date: October 10, 1925\nStatus: In progress. Making the most careful stitches of my life.",
      "character_interpretations": {
        "dressmaker": "Looking at these measurements, I notice what Elias noticed—Cordelia is getting thinner. Her frame is becoming more delicate, her waist narrower than it should be. I remember seeing his notes about the adjustments needed, the way he documented the changes with such care. These measurements aren't just numbers. Cordelia was getting sicker. Every fitting required new adjustments."

      "title": "Rose Bread Recipe (From Cordelia)",
      "content": "She brought me this today. Said it was her grandmother's recipe, something her family has made for generations.\n\nIngredients:\n- Bread flour: 500g\n- Warm water: 350ml\n- Instant yeast: 7g\n- Sea salt: 10g\n- Honey: 15g\n- Olive oil: 30ml\n- Rose water: 1/4 teaspoon (USE SPARINGLY—this is precious)\n- Dried rose petals: 2 tablespoons, finely ground\n\nMethod:\nMix flour, water, yeast, salt, honey, and oil.\nKnead for 8-10 minutes until smooth.\nAfter dough rises slightly (1-2 hours), fold in rose water and ground rose petals carefully.\nLet rise for 4-6 hours (or overnight in refrigerator).\nShape into a round loaf.\nFinal rise 2-3 hours.\nBake at 450°F for 35-40 minutes.\nBrush with honey glaze before final bake.\n\nNote from Cordelia: 'This bread carries memory. Every person who eats it becomes part of our family's story. I want Eleanor to have this—to know she is connected to something beautiful, even if she doesn't know all the reasons why.'\n\nI copied this carefully. I will make sure Eleanor receives it.",
      "character_interpretations": {
        "dressmaker": "Who is Eleanor? Cordelia speaks of her with such tenderness, such careful purpose. 'She is connected to something beautiful'. I know everything about Cordelia. Yet this Eleanor is a mystery. Someone important enough to receive a family recipe, a legacy of rose and honey. Someone Cordelia wants to protect. I will deliver this recipe as faithfully as I deliver her wedding dress, but I confess—I am consumed with curiosity about this unseen Eleanor."

      "content": "I finished the wedding dress today.\n\nEvery stitch is a prayer.\nEvery seam is a memory.\nEvery button is something I will never be able to give her.\n\nI pressed it carefully. Wrapped it in tissue. Stored it in the back room where no one goes.\n\nShe will never wear it now.\n\nSomething is wrong. I can see it in the way she moves, the way she breathes. The dress hangs unworn in the darkness, like a ghost of the future that will never arrive.\n\nI will keep it. I will preserve it. \n\nMaybe someday someone will understand what this dress means. What it meant to make it. What it means to love someone you can never have.\n\nMaybe keeping it will be enough."
