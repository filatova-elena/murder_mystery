      "title": "On Dr. Morrison and Lesser Minds",
      "is_spoiler": false,
      "content": "The Morrison clinic is insufferable. Dr. Morrison is competent enough, I suppose, but his method lacks refinement. He approaches medicine as if it were mere carpentry—measuring, testing, building without vision. Medicine is art. It requires imagination, intuition, the kind of intellectual superiority that separates the truly great physicians from the merely adequate."

      "is_spoiler": false,
      "content": "I prescribed a new tonic for Mrs. Harrington today. She will attribute any improvement to my brilliance. Of course, the improvement comes from her own body's natural healing—but she will never understand this. People need to believe in their doctor. They need to feel their fate rests in superior hands. It is kinder this way."

      "content": "Alice is exceptional. Maddening, infuriating, brilliant Alice. She possesses an understanding of human nature that borders on supernatural. When she looks at me, I believe she truly sees me—not the veneer of respectability, but the architect beneath. The Architect of my own destiny."

      "content": "Tonight we spoke in the parlor after examining a patient. Her hand brushed mine. The contact was electric. She said: \"You are not what people believe you are, Thaddeus. You are far too intelligent to simply... exist within their expectations.\"\n\nShe understands. She alone understands."

      "content": "The risk is considerable. Alice is unmarried, her reputation precarious. But the risk is also exquisite. To be known, truly known, by someone of her caliber—it justifies everything."

        "is_spoiler": false,
        "content": "My brother Sebastian called this evening with news of his engagement. Cordelia Montrose. Excellent match. The Montrose name carries weight, and her family's resources will be substantial when the time comes. Sebastian seems genuinely besotted. Weakness, truly. Love is a biological impulse dressed up in sentiment."

      "content": "Sebastian's wedding is planned for October. Cordelia has consented to the marriage with apparent eagerness. He has begun work on some alchemical formula—an \"Elixir of Eternal Love,\" he calls it with embarrassing earnestness. He consulted with me about the botanical ingredients."

        "content": "I visited Sebastian in the garage laboratory where he works on his formula. He showed me the refined elixir—a pale amber liquid in that ostentatious Venetian bottle he acquired in Milano.\n\n\"It's perfect,\" he said. \"Eight months of work, and I've finally achieved the balance.\"\n\nI examined it carefully. Harmless compounds, mostly. Sentimental choices. I made a note of every ingredient."

      "is_spoiler": false,
      "content": "I suggested mostly harmless compounds for his formula, though I did note that foxglove would be quite useful for cardiac applications. He took careful notes. \"Why would I use foxglove?\" he asked. \"Love has nothing to do with the heart's physiology.\"\n\nI smiled. \"Precisely the thinking of a craftsman, not an artist, Sebastian.\""

Some moment of decision I have not yet fully acknowledged, even to myself.\n\nI lie awake considering possibilities. Hypothetically. Academically. What would be the most elegant approach?"

      "content": "I examined him with clinical precision. The symptoms are consistent with... several possibilities. I made careful notes. Cardiac stress. Tremor. Confusion. His pulse is erratic.\n\n\"You are a brilliant mind in a fool's body,\" I told him. \"Artists should never work alone.\"\n\nI prescribed rest and observation. Let him rest easy while I figure out what to do!"

      "is_spoiler": false,
      "content": "I prescribed an herbal tea that might provide comfort. It will do nothing, of course. But he will believe I am trying to help him. This is what patients need—the illusion of medical intervention.\n\nAs he left, I felt oddly empty. As if I were watching myself from outside my own body."

      "title": "Torn Pages - Regret",
      "is_spoiler": true,
      "content": "[These pages are torn, water-stained, and marked with violent strikethrough. The handwriting deteriorates throughout, becoming increasingly frantic.]\n\nI cannot continue this deception. I cannot. The weight of it is suffocating me. When Sebastian walked into my office today, pale and trembling, describing the very symptoms I knew he would describe, I felt something splinter inside me. This is what I have done. This.\n\nI have ruined him. Cordelia too. They will both suffer because of my arrogance, my resentment, my pathetic need to escape my brother's shadow. And for what? For Alice? For some imagined transformation of my circumstances? What have I become?\n\nAlice came to see me this evening. She knew something was wrong—she always knows. I could not lie to her. I told her everything. The formula. The foxglove. My intentions. My weakness.\n\nShe listened in silence, and then she took my hands and said: \"Thaddeus, you must confess. You must go to the authorities and tell them what you have done. You must save yourself before this destroys you completely.\"\n\n[Pages torn here]\n\nBut I cannot confess. I cannot. If I do, everything ends. My reputation. My practice. My freedom. Perhaps my life itself. I tried to explain this to Alice, and she looked at me with such disappointment. Such contempt, even.\n\n\"You murdered them,\" she said quietly. \"Not with bravery. Not with conviction. But with cowardice. You did this terrible thing and now you lack the courage to face it.\"\n\nI told her she was wrong. That I had no choice. That circumstances forced my hand. But we both knew I was lying.\n\n[Final pages heavily crossed through]\n\nI am a coward. A murderer and a coward. This is what I am. This is what I have always been, beneath the veneer of superiority. Alice sees it now. She sees me clearly for the first time, and she is disgusted.\n\nI cannot confess. But I cannot live with this either. I am trapped between two impossible truths, and I have no path forward that does not end in destruction."

A young woman's heart failing after her fiancé's sudden death, considering what she suffered, it is not surprising. I sat with her through her final hours. She was delirious with pain, confused, asking for Sebastian. I gave her morphine. I held her hand with genuine compassion while my other hand made careful notes of her declining vital signs."
