# Character Answer Guide - The Lost Souls of Kennebec Avenue

## HEIRESS
**Objective 1: What happened to 3 people in 1925?**
- **Answer**: Alice was murdered by Dr. Thaddeus Crane (blunt force trauma, staged as fall). Sebastian was poisoned with foxglove by his brother Thaddeus. Cordelia was slowly poisoned by Sebastian over 44 days (unknowingly—formula was corrupted by Thaddeus).
- **Evidence**: Death certificates, Silas's private notes, Cordelia's diary, cordelia's measurements show rapid physical decline Sept 4 - Oct 18.
- **Data Sources**: documents/death_cert_*.json, journals/silas_private_notes.json, journals/cordelia_diary.json

**Objective 2: Uncover family secrets**
- **Answer**: Cordelia's biological daughter Eleanor was given up at birth to the Sullivan family. Eleanor became a baker and her descendants never knew they were Montrose heirs (until the fire). The true heir is the Baker character, not the Heiress.
- **Evidence**: Eleanor's diary mentions search for identity, rose bread recipe from Cordelia, facts about adoption.
- **Data Sources**: journals/eleanor_diary.json (with Baker), facts.json

**Objective 3: Understand who really owns the estate**
- **Answer**: Legally, the Baker (Eleanor's descendant) is the true heir as Cordelia's biological child. The Heiress is a distant relation. The prenup agreement shows no marriage occurred—just engagement.
- **Evidence**: Prenup agreement dated Aug 15, 1925, payment records showing bribe to Silas, Cordelia's diary proving the secret
- **Data Sources**: documents/prenup_agreement.txt (if created), facts.json (fiduciary_fact_2)

- **Data Sources**: journals/eleanor_diary.json, visions (Alice connecting to family line)

**Objective 2: Where did Eleanor's diary come from?**
- **Answer**: Eleanor wrote it after learning she was adopted. She was given the diary as a baby hidden in blankets during the bakery fire (1980s-90s). Your parents/ancestors died in that fire.
- **Evidence**: Eleanor's diary documents her search for identity, mentions of adoption, rose bread recipe as inheritance
- **Data Sources**: journals/eleanor_diary.json

**Objective 3: Why connection to Montrose?**
- **Answer**: Eleanor was Cordelia Montrose's secret biological daughter. Cordelia gave Eleanor up at birth to the Sullivan family (1925). You inherited the rose bread recipe—Cordelia's grandmother's recipe that she entrusted to Elias Monroe to pass to Eleanor.

## DRESSMAKER
**Objective 1: What really happened to Cordelia?**
- **Answer**: Cordelia was poisoned slowly over 44 days by the "Elixir of Eternal Love" that Sebastian created. The elixir was corrupted by Thaddeus Crane with foxglove. She died of cumulative toxin damage, not a broken heart.
- **Evidence**: Cordelia's diary shows Sept 4 start of elixir ritual, progressive symptoms (Oct 8: "I am afraid"), death Oct 18. Elias's notes show he suspected something was wrong ("She will never wear it now").
- **Data Sources**: journals/cordelia_diary.json, journals/elias_work_notes.json, documents/death_cert_cordelia.json

**Objective 2: Why reject Elias for Sebastian?**
- **Answer**: Cordelia loved Sebastian because he offered stability and devotion after Thomas (her first love) abandoned her. She chose grounded stability over uncertain artistic passion. She never knew Elias was in love with her.
- **Evidence**: Cordelia's diary shows she valued Sebastian's constancy. Elias's poems were unsent—she never knew his true feelings. Thomas left/was lost at sea.
- **Data Sources**: journals/cordelia_diary.json, journals/elias_work_notes.json, facts.json

**Objective 3: Why disappear in early 1925?**
- **Answer**: ⚠️ **INSUFFICIENT DATA IN DATA FOLDER** - Story mentions she was pregnant and gave birth to Eleanor in secret, then baby was adopted by Sullivans. This detail is NOT confirmed in journals/documents folder.
- **Available Evidence**: Cordelia's diary entry mentions "Eleanor" as her daughter; Eleanor's diary mentions adoption; but explicit pregnancy/disappearance timeline not documented.
- **Data Sources**: journals/cordelia_diary.json (final thoughts), journals/eleanor_diary.json

- **Available Evidence**: Payment records show cash payment, no authorization mark, "confidential arrangement" notation
- **Data Sources**: documents/payment_records.json

**Objective 3: Pattern across 3 deaths?**
- **Answer**: All three deaths occurred within 11 days at same location, all certified by Dr. Thaddeus Crane (brother/family insider). Timeline suggests coordinated cover-up, not coincidence.

## FIDUCIARY
**Objective 1: Who paid the Mortician?**
- **Answer**: ⚠️ **INSUFFICIENT DATA** - Payment records document $500 paid but don't name payer. Likely Dr. Thaddeus Crane or someone from Montrose family to silence Silas.

- **Data Sources**: documents/payment_records.json

**Objective 2: Who is true heir?**
- **Answer**: The Baker (Eleanor's descendant) is the true legal heir as Cordelia's biological child. The Heiress is distant relation. Prenup shows no marriage occurred—engagement only.

- **Data Sources**: facts.json (fiduciary_fact_2, baker_fact_2), journals/eleanor_diary.json

**Objective 3: Who was Sebastian Crane?**
- **Answer**: Sebastian was an apothecary/pharmacist known as "The Alchemist" in Romano's bootlegging operation. He created harmless botanical formulas but was set up by his brother Thaddeus who poisoned his creation. He's the accidental victim, not perpetrator.

- **Data Sources**: journals/sebastian_notebooks.json, journals/hartley_consultation.json, facts.json

---

## PROFESSOR
**Objective 1: Was ancestor Edmund involved?**
- **Answer**: No, Edmund Hartley was NOT involved in murders. His consultation notes show he approved a completely harmless formula for Sebastian. Edmund was innocent—Thaddeus corrupted the formula AFTER consultation.
- **Evidence**: Hartley's consultation notes document all ingredients as non-lethal at those concentrations. Timeline shows consultation before substitution occurred.
- **Data Sources**: journals/hartley_consultation.json, character_interpretations noting Edmund's innocence

**Objective 2: Identify poison used**
- **Answer**: Foxglove (cardiac glycoside). Used in two different ways: acute high-dose for Sebastian (rapid death), slow accumulating doses for Cordelia (44-day timeline). Both show cardiac damage.
- **Evidence**: Death certificates mention foxglove suspected but not confirmed. Silas's notes document organ damage patterns consistent with foxglove. Timeline (Sept 4 - Oct 18 = 44 days) matches foxglove accumulation.
- **Data Sources**: documents/death_cert_sebastian.json, journals/silas_private_notes.json

**Objective 3: What was Harbor Import & Trading Co?**

## CLOCKMAKER
**Objective 1: Who owned the pocket watch?**
- **Answer**: ⚠️ **INSUFFICIENT DATA** - Watch shows Sept 4, 1925 conjunction date, but owner not identified in data folder. Likely related to alchemical/magical significance of conjunction date for poisoning ritual.
- **Available Evidence**: Pocket watch exists, engraved with conjunction date and symbols, found in possession (origin unclear)
- **Data Sources**: facts.json (clockmaker_fact_2)

**Objective 2: Significance of Sept 4, 1925?**
- **Answer**: Jupiter-Venus conjunction occurred at 6:14 AM. This is significant because poisoning began exactly on this date (Cordelia's diary: "The Ritual Begins" Sept 4). Represents deliberate magical/alchemical timing by perpetrator.
- **Evidence**: Cordelia's diary entry Sept 4 marks start of elixir ritual. Death on Oct 18 is exactly 44 days later (meaningful number in occult traditions).
- **Data Sources**: journals/cordelia_diary.json (Sept 4 entry), facts.json (clockmaker_fact_1), documents/death_cert_cordelia.json (44-day timing)

**Objective 3: Timeline reveals what?**
- **Answer**: Timeline shows three coordinated deaths, but with different poisoning methods/speeds. Alice (immediate murder). Sebastian (poisoning accelerated in final days). Cordelia (slow ritual poisoning over 44 days). Different patterns suggest different intentionality.
- **Evidence**: Oct 7 (Alice), Oct 11 (Sebastian), Oct 18 (Cordelia) = 11-day span. But Cordelia's timeline goes back to Sept 4 (conjunction date).
- **Data Sources**: documents/death_cert_*.json with date comparisons

- **Data Sources**: data/long_beach_mysteries.json, rumors.json

**Objective 2: Rational explanation for "mystical" events?**
- **Answer**: No supernatural elements required. September 4 conjunction is coincidental/used as ritual justification. Three deaths explained by one perpetrator (Thaddeus Crane). Baker's psychic sensitivity is inherited sensitivity, not magic.
- **Evidence**: All deaths have logical explanations (murder, poisoning). Timeline matches intentional poisoning start date, not astrological cause.
- **Data Sources**: journals/cordelia_diary.json, documents/death_cert_*.json, facts.json

**Objective 3: Connect all episodes?**
- **Answer**: 1925 murders of Cordelia/Sebastian/Alice → Montrose family cover-up → Sullivan bakery fire was assassination of true heir's family → Romano treasure hidden at Montrose mansion → Present investigation reveals all connected

- **Answer**: Sebastian Crane ("The Alchemist") haunts location believing his formula was flawed and killed his fiancée. In reality, he was innocent—his brother Thaddeus corrupted the formula. Sebastian was victim, not perpetrator.
- **Evidence**: Sebastian's notebooks show innocent intent; his understanding notes show guilt for something he didn't do
- **Data Sources**: journals/sebastian_notebooks.json

**Objective 3: Secret formula discovery**
- **Answer**: The "Elixir of Eternal Love" - Sebastian's harmless botanical formula (damiana, valerian, rose otto, potassium bromide, calcium lactate, iron citrate). Thaddeus substituted foxglove for one ingredient (likely the rose otto).
