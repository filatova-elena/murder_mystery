        <h2>üíî Cordelia & Thomas: The Secret Baby</h2>
        <p><em>A Romance That Changed Everything</em></p>
  
        <p><strong>Summer 1924:</strong> Cordelia Montrose‚Äîromantic, dreamy, twenty-five years old‚Äîmet Thomas Edward Whitmore at the Port of Long Beach. He was her best friend Alice's older brother. A merchant marine captain, about thirty, with stories of exotic ports and distant horizons.</p>
  
        <p>To Cordelia's sheltered life, Thomas was everything: adventurous, worldly, free. He promised to take her away, show her the world. It was a whirlwind romance. Passionate. All-consuming. The kind of love that burns bright and fast.</p>
  
        <p>Then Thomas sailed away. Did he mean to come back? Did he truly love her? We'll never know.</p>
  
        <p>He left without knowing Cordelia was pregnant.</p>
  
        <p><strong>The Scandal (Early 1925):</strong> The Montrose family was horrified. An unmarried daughter pregnant by a sailor? Unacceptable. They sent Cordelia away on "extended vacation." Her friend Alice complained she hadn't seen Cordelia in months, that Cordelia had become distant.</p>
  
        <p>In secret, Cordelia gave birth to a baby girl. The Montrose family arranged for the baby to be given to the Sullivan family‚Äîrespectable bakers in Long Beach.</p>
  
        <p><strong>Critical detail: The adoption was never legally finalized.</strong> On paper, that baby remained Cordelia Montrose's legitimate heir.</p>
  
        <p>Thomas Whitmore died at sea in 1925 or 1926, never knowing he had a daughter.</p>
  
        <p><strong>The Baby's Journey:</strong></p>
        <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
          <li><strong>Eleanor Sullivan (born 1925):</strong> Grew up never knowing her birth parents. Wrote in her diary about searching for identity, about the hollow place where belonging should be. Preserved "my grandmother's bread recipe"‚Äîher only real inheritance.</li>
          <li><strong>Generations 2 & 3:</strong> Eleanor's descendants ran the Sullivan bakery, used that bread recipe, lived good lives. None knew they were Montrose heirs.</li>
          <li><strong>1980s-1990s:</strong> Somehow the Montrose family discovered the truth. The Sullivan family was eliminated‚Äîarson, murder‚Äîto protect the inheritance.</li>
          <li><strong>The Baker (present day):</strong> Orphan with Eleanor's diary and that treasured bread recipe. Psychic sensitivity inherited from Alice's bloodline. The true heir to the Montrose fortune.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <p><strong>What the Baker Doesn't Know:</strong> They're investigating their own great-great-grandmother's murder. They're standing in the mansion that should rightfully be theirs. The Heiress is living in their home.</p>
  
        <p>The diary holds the key to everything.</p>

        <h2>‚öóÔ∏è Sebastian, The Alchemist</h2>
        <p><em>The Bootlegger Behind the Pharmacy</em></p>
  
        <p>By day: Sebastian Montgomery Crane, respectable pharmacist. Clean-cut, well-spoken, engaged to a Montrose.</p>
  
        <p>By night: "The Alchemist"‚Äîone of Frankie Romano's most valuable assets in the bootlegging operation.</p>
  
        <p><strong>His Genius:</strong> Prohibition allowed alcohol for "medicinal purposes." Sebastian created high-quality bootleg spirits disguised as medicinal tonics. His elixirs, tinctures, and "pharmaceutical preparations" were famous in certain circles. Legal cover, illegal profits.</p>
  
        <p><strong>His Operation:</strong> Harbor Import & Trading Co. (Frankie's smuggling front) supplied exotic ingredients‚Äîsome legitimate, some not. Sebastian's pharmaceutical expertise made him invaluable. He knew chemistry. He knew plants. He knew how to make things taste good and work better.</p>
  
        <p><strong>The Dock Argument (September 1925):</strong> When Sebastian got engaged to Cordelia Montrose, he wanted out. High society was sniffing around. The Montrose family had connections. He needed to go legitimate.</p>
  
        <p>Frankie was furious: "You SWORE this would be the biggest take we ever seen! And now that the dough's finally rollin' in, you wanna beat it and play Mr. Respectable?"</p>
  
        <p>The argument was public. Loud. Witnesses everywhere. When Sebastian died shortly after, everyone assumed Frankie did it.</p>
  
        <p>But Frankie didn't kill Sebastian. The real killer was family.</p>
  
        <p><strong>The Great Work:</strong> Sebastian was also a romantic. He believed in alchemy, in the marriage of science and mysticism. His "Elixir of Eternal Love" was meant to be his masterpiece‚Äîa harmless formula using traditional aphrodisiacs and modern pharmacy to strengthen the bond between lovers.</p>
  
        <p>He prepared it with obsessive precision. Consulted botanical experts. Timed it for the Jupiter-Venus conjunction. Believed cosmic alignment would amplify its power.</p>
  
        <p>He had no idea his brother had sabotaged it with deadly foxglove.</p>
  
        <p>Sebastian died thinking his Great Work failed. That he'd gotten the chemistry wrong. That his own incompetence destroyed everything.</p>
  
        <p>He died never knowing he was innocent.</p>

        <h2>üé≠ The Romano Family: Rise and Fall</h2>
        <p><em>From Rum Runners to Art Dealers</em></p>
  
        <p><strong>1920s - The Glory Days:</strong> Frankie "the Coast" Romano ruled the Port of Long Beach during Prohibition. Rum running from Mexico. Bootleg alcohol disguised as medicine. Exotic goods smuggled through Harbor Import & Trading Co. Connected, ruthless, respected.</p>
  
        <p>He supplied Sebastian Crane‚Äî"The Alchemist"‚Äîwith bootleg spirits and rare botanical specimens. When Sebastian tried to leave the operation after getting engaged, Frankie confronted him at the docks. A public argument. Dock workers watching. Frankie shouting: "You don't just WALK AWAY from Frankie Romano!"</p>
  
        <p>When Sebastian died days later, everyone assumed Frankie did it. But he didn't. (The real killer was much closer to home.)</p>
  
        <p><strong>1930s-1950s - Hollywood Heights:</strong> The Romano family went "legitimate"‚Äînightclubs, gambling, early film industry connections. Flashy parties with starlets and producers. New money at its trashiest and most visible. Tabloids loved them.</p>
  
        <p><strong>1960s-1980s - The Collapse:</strong> The IRS came knocking. Investigations. Seizures. Everything lost. Bank accounts frozen. Properties auctioned. The Romano fortune destroyed.</p>
  
        <p>What survived: a few "family artifacts"‚Äîan ornate glass bottle, old shipping manifests, photographs from better days.</p>
  
        <p><strong>Present Day - The Art Collector:</strong> The Art Collector grew up on whispers of past glory and faded photographs. Learned art dealing through necessity, discovered genuine talent. Now runs a legitimate business‚Äîbut still dabbles in questionable provenance and shady deals. One foot in legitimacy, one in the shadows.</p>
  
        <p>The Romano way.</p>
  
        <p>That ornate glass bottle Andy displays proudly as a family heirloom? It held the poison that killed three people. Andy has no idea.</p>
  
        <p><strong>The Legendary Treasure:</strong> Rumors persist about hidden Romano wealth that escaped the IRS. The Explorer is searching for it. The Art Collector hopes it exists. But does it? Or is it just a desperate family myth?</p>

        <h2>ü•Ä Sebastian's Elixir</h2>
        <p><em>Cordelia & Sebastian's Fatal Love (1925)</em></p>
      
        <p>They met at a secret cocktail party in September 1925‚Äîone of those illicit speakeasy gatherings where Long Beach society pretended to be scandalous. Prohibition made everyone feel dangerous, even when they weren't.</p>
      
        <p>Sebastian Crane stood in the corner with his dark eyes and mysterious smile, watching the crowd. He was a pharmacist, respectable but with an edge that made him interesting. Smooth. Controlled. The kind of man who mixed potions and believed in chemistry‚Äîboth the scientific and romantic kind.</p>
      
        <p>Then Cordelia laughed‚Äîbright and reckless‚Äîand he couldn't look away.</p>
      
        <p>She had big brown eyes that sparkled with mischief, the kind of eyes that belonged in fairy tales. She was impulsive where other society girls were careful, daring where they were demure. She pressed flowers and believed in destiny, but she also snuck into speakeasies and danced too close to danger.</p>
      
        <p>They fell in love. The engagement came within weeks, the wedding planned for November.</p>
      
        <p>Sebastian, arrogant and romantic in equal measure, wanted to make their bond unbreakable. He created a special elixir‚Äîa tonic to strengthen their love, to bind them together forever. He gave it to her with poetry and promises.</p>
      
        <p>Though the elixir should have been harmless, someone else had access to it. Someone who added foxglove‚Äîdeadly, invisible, perfect. By the time Cordelia grew weak and confused, it was too late.</p>
      
        <p>Sebastian died believing he had killed the woman he loved. Cordelia died never knowing the truth. And somewhere, the real poisoner walked free.</p>
      
        <p>Some romances are written in the stars. Theirs was written in poison‚Äîbut whose hand held the pen?</p>

        <h2>üíî The Dressmaker's Devotion</h2>
        <p><em>Elias Monroe's Unrequited Love (1925)</em></p>
      
        <p>Elias Monroe was a dressmaker with an artist's eye and a romantic's heart. The day Cordelia Montrose walked into his shop, he fell in love.</p>
      
        <p>He sent her flowers, wrote her poems, made her dresses that would make other women weep with envy. Each stitch was a declaration of devotion she never seemed to see. She smiled at him kindly, but her eyes never lingered.</p>
      
        <p>Then she disappeared for months in early 1925. When she returned, the lightness had gone out of her. She carried something heavy, something unspeakable. She rushed toward a wedding with unseemly haste.</p>
      
        <p>Then came Sebastian Crane‚Äîdark-mysterious, charming, yet stable, not like her first love Thomas Whitmore. Cordelia fell like a moth to flame. Elias tried to tell her that Sebastian was not the man for her, that he was too dangerous, but she dismissed him.</p>
      
        <p>So he made her wedding dress instead. White silk and lace, every stitch a prayer. He tucked a lock of her hair into the hem‚Äîa secret goodbye.</p>
      
        <p>By September, she looked pale, thin, trembling. Three weeks later, Cordelia was dead. Sebastian was dead. Alice was dead.</p>
      
        <p><strong>His Legacy:</strong> Elias kept everything‚Äîthe unworn dress, the unsent letters, the journal tracking a love story only he knew existed. Generations later, his descendant inherited it all, along with one burning question: What really happened to Cordelia?</p>
      
        <p>The wedding dress still hangs, perfectly preserved. Waiting for answers.</p>

      <h2>ü©∫ Dr. Thaddeus & Alice: Forbidden Romance</h2>
      <p><em>The Affair That Led to Murder</em></p>

      <p><strong>She was his patient.</strong> That alone made it unforgivable.</p>

      <p>Dr. Thaddeus Crane was the respected town physician‚ÄîSebastian's older brother, professional, ethical. Alice Whitmore came to him because other doctors wanted to institutionalize her. They called her "unstable," "hysterical," said her visions were delusions.</p>

      <p>But Dr. Thaddeus believed her. He recognized Alice was truly psychic‚Äînot insane, just sensitive to truths others couldn't perceive. He listened. He understood.</p>

      <p>And he fell completely in love with her.</p>

      <p><strong>The Forbidden Affair:</strong> Doctor-patient relationships were absolutely forbidden. But Alice was extraordinary‚Äîbrilliant, gifted, and she saw him truly. They conducted their affair in secret. Coded correspondence. Hidden meetings. The thrill and danger of something they both knew was wrong.</p>

      <p><strong>The Threat (August 1925):</strong> Cordelia Montrose discovered their affair. She confronted Dr. Thaddeus with an ultimatum: "End the affair immediately, or I will expose you to the medical board. Your career will be destroyed."</p>

      <p>Dr. Thaddeus was trapped. Everything he'd built‚Äîhis reputation, his practice, his social standing‚Äîcould be destroyed by one scandal.</p>

      <p>He realized he had only one way out: eliminate Cordelia.</p>

      <p><strong>The Poisoning Plan:</strong> He knew his brother Sebastian was making a romantic elixir for Cordelia. Sebastian consulted him about botanical properties, asked medical questions, showed him the formula. It was harmless‚Äîfoolish, perhaps, but not dangerous.</p>

      <p>Dr. Thaddeus saw opportunity. He obtained concentrated foxglove extract and secretly added it to Sebastian's prepared elixir. Sebastian would unknowingly poison Cordelia daily. It would look like natural illness. No one would suspect murder.</p>

      <p>The perfect crime.</p>

      <p><strong>October 7, 1925 - When Everything Fell Apart:</strong> Sebastian tested his own elixir and collapsed. Dr. Thaddeus realized with horror: <em>He'd murdered his own brother.</em> Sebastian was never supposed to taste the formula!</p>

      <p>For four days, Thaddeus desperately searched for an antidote. Consulted experts. Researched treatments. Purchased strange compounds. But foxglove is unforgiving. Sebastian was dying, and Thaddeus couldn't save him.</p>

      <p><strong>October 10, 1925 (Evening) - The Confession:</strong> Wracked with guilt, Thaddeus went to Alice and confessed everything. He needed absolution. Forgiveness. Told her the whole terrible truth.</p>

      <p>Alice was horrified. She told him he had to confess to authorities. Maybe it wasn't too late. Maybe they could still save Cordelia.</p>

      <p>But Thaddeus realized Alice wouldn't back down, wouldn't protect him. She would expose him.</p>

      <p><strong>October 11, 1925 - The Third Murder:</strong> That night, Dr. Thaddeus killed the woman he loved. Struck her with a silver candle holder. Blunt force trauma to the head. Instant death.</p>

      <p>He staged it as an accidental fall down the stairs. Everyone believed it‚ÄîAlice was known to be "unstable," possibly drunk. A tragic accident.</p>

      <p><strong>The Guilt:</strong> Dr. Thaddeus lived with his crimes for twenty-seven years. In his sealed diary, he wrote:</p>
      <p style="font-style: italic; background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.1); padding: 15px; border-left: 3px solid #8b4513;">
        "I murdered my brother. I murdered the woman who loved me. I murdered Cordelia to protect an affair. Alice saw me for what I truly am. When she threatened to expose me, I killed her without hesitation. I cannot live with this."
      </p>

      <p>He died in 1952, taking his terrible secret to the grave.</p>

      <p>His descendants changed the family name from Crane to Sinclair in 1965, trying to escape the scandal. But the truth remained, hidden in sealed laboratories and forgotten diaries.</p>

      <p>Until now.</p>

        <h2>üîÆ The Psychic Who Couldn't Save Her</h2>
        <p><em>C√©lestine Laveau & Alice Whitmore (1925)</em></p>
      
        <p>C√©lestine Laveau was world-famous long before she arrived in California. The French psychic medium had dazzled European aristocracy with her abilities‚Äîreading minds, communing with spirits, predicting futures with unsettling accuracy. When the spiritualism boom swept America in the 1920s, she came west, and Long Beach society clamored for her attention.</p>
      
        <p>Most of her clients were wealthy dilettantes playing at the occult. Parlor tricks for bored housewives. Theatrical s√©ances for thrill-seekers.</p>
      
        <p>Then Alice Whitmore walked into her salon.</p>
      
        <p>C√©lestine knew immediately‚Äîthis girl was different. Alice wasn't performing. She wasn't pretending. She had the genuine gift, raw and untrained, manifesting in dreams and visions she couldn't control. The spirits spoke to Alice whether she wanted them to or not.</p>
      
        <p>"You have a rare ability, ma ch√©rie," C√©lestine told her. "But it is dangerous without training. Let me teach you."</p>
      
        <p>Alice was eager to learn, desperate to understand the visions that haunted her. C√©lestine began mentoring her‚Äîteaching her to focus, to protect herself, to distinguish between true spiritual communication and her own fears.</p>
      
        <p>But Alice was also reckless. Impulsive. She fell into an affair with Dr. Thaddeus, ignored warnings, pushed boundaries. C√©lestine sensed darkness gathering around the girl but couldn't make her listen.</p>
      
        <p>Then in October 1925, Alice was murdered.</p>
      
        <p><strong>The Haunting:</strong> C√©lestine felt it immediately‚ÄîAlice's spirit, trapped, confused, unable to move on. The violence of her death, the secrets she carried, the unfinished business‚Äîit all anchored her to the mortal world.</p>
      
        <p>C√©lestine tried everything. S√©ances, rituals, prayers. But Alice's spirit was bound by something stronger than death‚Äîby truth that needed telling, by justice that needed finding, by a story that refused to stay buried.</p>
      
        <p>C√©lestine Laveau, the famous psychic who had helped countless spirits find peace, could not save the one that mattered most. She died in 1947, her greatest failure haunting her legacy.</p>
      
        <p>Nearly a century later, her great-granddaughter Margo arrived in Long Beach, carrying the family name and the weight of unfinished business. Alice Whitmore was still calling. Still waiting.</p>
      
        <p>Some debts echo through generations.</p>

        <h2>‚è∞ The Clockmaker's Obsession</h2>
        <p><em>Time, Consciousness, and Sacred Timing</em></p>
  
        <p>The Clockmaker talks a mile a minute while their hands are always tinkering. Caffeine-fueled chaos. Sleep? Never heard of her. Covered in tiny gears and oil stains.</p>
  
        <p>They see the world as one giant clock that's slightly out of sync. And they're obsessed with fixing it.</p>
  
        <p><strong>The Pocket Watch:</strong> For years, they've been restoring an antique pocket watch from 1925. Beautiful craftsmanship. Intricate mechanism. But there's something engraved inside: <strong>September 4</strong> and strange astronomical symbols.</p>
  
        <p>The Clockmaker calculated it: September 4, 1925, at 6:14 AM‚Äîa rare Jupiter-Venus conjunction. The alignment happens once in decades. Someone thought this date was important enough to engrave it permanently.</p>
  
        <p><strong>The Research:</strong> The Clockmaker became obsessed. What happened on September 4, 1925? Why did someone commemorate this conjunction? They researched alchemical timing traditions, studied historical records, made endless calculations.</p>
  
        <p>Then the Influencer featured them in "Long Beach Urban Legends"‚Äîthe mysterious watch, the conjunction, the timing. The episode led them both to the Montrose mansion, to three deaths in October 1925, exactly five weeks after that sacred conjunction.</p>
  
        <p><strong>The Helmet Project:</strong> But the Clockmaker isn't just about external time. They're building something revolutionary: a device exploring the intersection of neuroscience and mystical experience. A "consciousness helmet" that maps brain activity during moments of spiritual significance.</p>
  
        <p>The Influencer thinks it's pseudoscience. "You're just measuring brain chemistry. There's nothing mystical about it."</p>
  
        <p>The Clockmaker disagrees: "Just because you can measure something doesn't mean it isn't real. The mystics were right about timing. The alchemists understood something we've forgotten. Consciousness isn't just neurons firing‚Äîit's part of a larger pattern. A cosmic clock."</p>
  
        <p>They argue constantly. The Influencer documents everything for content. The Clockmaker keeps building, keeps calculating, keeps tinkering.</p>
  
        <p><strong>The Truth About September 4:</strong> Sebastian Crane engraved that watch to commemorate his "Great Work"‚Äîthe Jupiter-Venus conjunction when he first administered his Elixir of Eternal Love. He believed cosmic timing would amplify the formula's power.</p>
  
        <p>He was wrong about the elixir. But was he wrong about timing?</p>
  
        <p>The Clockmaker wonders: What if Sebastian understood something real? What if consciousness, love, and cosmic alignment are all connected in ways science hasn't measured yet?</p>
  
        <p>The watch keeps ticking. The investigation continues. And the Clockmaker keeps asking: <strong>Is there meaning in timing, or is the universe just a random collection of gears?</strong></p>
  
        <p>Maybe solving this century-old mystery will finally answer the question.</p>

        <h2>üî• The Sullivan Bakery Fire</h2>
        <p><em>A Modern Crime (1980s-1990s)</em></p>
  
        <p>For generations, the Sullivan family ran a beloved bakery in Long Beach. Their bread was famous‚Äîmade from a recipe passed down through the family since the 1920s. Good people. Hardworking. Known throughout the community.</p>
  
        <p>Then one night, the bakery burned.</p>
  
        <p>The official story: electrical fire, tragic accident. But the Influencer researched it for their "Long Beach Urban Legends" series and found inconsistencies. Accelerant patterns. A suspiciously rapid spread. Witnesses reported seeing someone fleeing the scene.</p>
  
        <p>The arsonist came in the darkness. The Baker's mother realized what was happening‚Äîclutching her baby, pleading: "Please, not the baby, they're innocent!"</p>
  
        <p>While begging for her child's life, she made one final act: she tucked an old diary under the baby's blankets. Her last gift. Her final defiance.</p>
  
        <p>The arsonist murdered the Baker's parents and grandparents. Set the fire. Destroyed everything. But couldn't kill the baby. Maybe conscience. Maybe mercy. Maybe just couldn't do it.</p>
  
        <p>The baby was taken to an orphanage‚Äîwith the diary hidden in the blankets, unseen. The last surviving member of the Sullivan family. An orphan with nothing but a mysterious diary and a bread recipe.</p>
  
        <p><strong>The Question:</strong> Who hired the arsonist? Why target a beloved bakery family?</p>
  
        <p><strong>The Answer:</strong> The Montrose family discovered the Sullivans were descended from Cordelia's secret baby. The true heirs to the Montrose fortune. So they eliminated the threat. Ruthlessly. Completely.</p>
  
        <p>All except one baby who survived.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>üëë The True Heir of Montrose Mansion</h2>
      <p><em>A Revelation</em></p>

      <p>The Heiress moved into the Montrose mansion thinking it was rightfully hers. The Fiduciary tracked her down, showed her the legal documents, confirmed she was a distant Montrose relative with a claim to the property.</p>

      <p>She was wrong.</p>

      <p><strong>The Secret:</strong> In early 1925, Cordelia Montrose gave birth to a daughter in secret. The baby was given to the Sullivan family‚Äîrespectable bakers in Long Beach. The arrangement was supposed to be an adoption.</p>

      <p>But the adoption was <strong>never legally finalized.</strong></p>

      <p>On paper, that baby‚ÄîEleanor Sullivan‚Äîremained Cordelia Montrose's legitimate biological heir. And every descendant after her inherited that legal status.</p>

      <p><strong>The Line of Inheritance:</strong></p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li><strong>Cordelia Rose Montrose</strong> (died 1925) ‚Üí legal owner of estate</li>
        <li><strong>Eleanor Sullivan</strong> (born 1925) ‚Üí biological heir, adoption never finalized</li>
        <li><strong>Eleanor's descendants</strong> (Sullivan family) ‚Üí ran bakery for generations</li>
        <li><strong>The Baker</strong> (present day) ‚Üí direct descendant, true heir</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Why the Montrose Family Never Claimed It:</strong> After the October 1925 tragedy, the mansion was essentially abandoned. Too haunted. Too tragic. Distant Montrose relatives inherited it but never lived there. For decades, it sat empty.</p>

      <p>Then in the 1980s-1990s, someone in the Montrose family discovered the truth: the Sullivan family were the real heirs. Legal research. Old documents. The incomplete adoption papers.</p>

      <p>The Montrose family's solution? <strong>Eliminate the threat.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>The Arson:</strong> They hired someone to burn the Sullivan bakery. Murder the family. Destroy any evidence of the connection. The Baker's parents and grandparents died in the fire.</p>

      <p>Only the baby survived‚Äîtaken to an orphanage with Eleanor's diary hidden in the blankets.</p>

      <p><strong>The Fiduciary's Mistake:</strong> When the Fiduciary researched the Montrose lineage, they found the Heiress‚Äîa legitimate distant relative. The documents seemed in order. The property had been abandoned for decades. They assumed she was the rightful heir.</p>

      <p>They never knew about the secret baby. Never found the incomplete adoption papers. Never realized the true heir was an orphan baker with psychic abilities and a mysterious old diary.</p>

      <p><strong>The Baker's Discovery:</strong> During the investigation, the Baker pieces it together:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li>Eleanor's diary mentions being adopted by the Sullivan family</li>
        <li>The diary contains "my grandmother's bread recipe"</li>
        <li>Eleanor writes about searching for her birth parents</li>
        <li>The Baker realizes: "I'm reading about my great-great-grandmother... and she didn't know who SHE was descended from either..."</li>
        <li>Documents reveal Cordelia Montrose had a secret baby in 1925</li>
        <li>The adoption was never finalized</li>
        <li>The Sullivan family fire wasn't an accident‚Äîit was murder</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>The Revelation:</strong> The Baker is standing in their own family's mansion. The Heiress is living in their home. The fortune, the property, the inheritance‚Äîit all belongs to the Baker.</p>

      <p>They're not just investigating a century-old murder mystery. They're investigating their own great-great-grandmother's death. Cordelia Montrose is their ancestor. Alice Whitmore is their great-great-grand-aunt. Thomas Whitmore‚Äîthe sailor who loved Cordelia‚Äîwas their great-great-grandfather.</p>

      <p>The psychic abilities the Baker always had? Inherited from Alice's bloodline.</p>

      <p>The bread recipe they've been baking their whole life? Passed down through four generations from Cordelia's baby.</p>

      <p>The diary that's been their only connection to family? Written by Cordelia's daughter, searching for the same answers.</p>

      <p><strong>What Happens Next?</strong> That's for the Baker to decide. Confront the Heiress? Claim their inheritance? Expose the Montrose family's modern crimes? Or just finally understand where they came from, who they are, and why they've always felt drawn to this story?</p>

      <p>The mansion has been waiting 100 years for its true heir to return home.</p>

      <p>The ghosts have been waiting for someone who shares their blood to finally hear their story.</p>

      <p>Welcome home.</p>
