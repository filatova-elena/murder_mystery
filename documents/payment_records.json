      "fiduciary": "October 18, 1925 - the same day Cordelia dies. A $500 payment to the mortician Silas Blackwell for 'Consultative Services - Medical Record Verification.' Standard funeral fees for three bodies would be $450. That additional $50 for 'consultative services' is unusual. No authorization mark. No official approval signature.",
      "heiress": "I found this entry in my family's records when I moved into the mansion. The Montrose estate paid $500 in cash to Silas Blackwell on the day Cordelia died. The notation says 'Confidential arrangement.' My family doesn't keep records of confidential arrangements. This wasn't a Montrose family decision.",
      "explorer": "Three funeral services ($450 total) plus $50 for 'consultative services' and a vague notation about 'verification and documentation.' The payment was made in cash with no paper trail and no authorization mark. Whoever paid Silas wanted the transaction untraceable.",
      "influencer": "The entry shows 'Ledger Notation: Expedited processing and handling of three deaths within 11-day period. Consultative fees for verification and documentation. Confidential arrangement.' Why would a mortuary document a 'confidential arrangement' in an official ledger? The whole point of confidentiality is that it's not recorded."
