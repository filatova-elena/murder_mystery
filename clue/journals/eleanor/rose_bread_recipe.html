        <li><strong>For the Dough:</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Bread flour:</strong> 500g (3½ cups)</li>
        <li><strong>Whole wheat flour:</strong> 100g (¾ cup) - optional, for depth</li>
        <li><strong>Warm water:</strong> 350ml (1½ cups)</li>
        <li><strong>Sea salt:</strong> 10g (2 tsp)</li>
        <li><strong>Instant yeast:</strong> 7g (2¼ tsp)</li>
        <li><strong>Honey:</strong> 15g (1 tbsp)</li>
        <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> 30ml (2 tbsp)</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>For the Rose Water Infusion:</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Food-grade rose water:</strong> ¼ teaspoon (use sparingly - this is precious)</li>
        <li><strong>Rose petals (dried, culinary grade):</strong> 2 tbsp, finely ground into powder</li>
        <li><strong>Honey (for finishing):</strong> 15ml (1 tbsp)</li>

      <h3>🍞 Instructions</h3>
      <ol class="instructions-list">
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough (10 minutes):</strong> Mix warm water, honey, and yeast in a large bowl. Let sit 5 minutes until foamy. Add bread flour, whole wheat flour, salt, and olive oil. Mix until shaggy dough forms.</li>
        
        <li><strong>First Rise (10 minutes):</strong> Knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. The dough should be slightly sticky but workable. Place in oiled bowl, cover with damp cloth.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Prepare Rose Infusion (5 minutes):</strong> While dough rests, combine rose water and ground rose petals in a small bowl. Let steep to release delicate fragrance. The rose should be subtle, not overwhelming.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Incorporate Rose (5 minutes):</strong> After 1-2 hours (when dough has risen slightly), gently fold the rose water mixture into the dough using a stretch-and-fold technique. Work carefully to distribute the rose evenly without deflating.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Bulk Fermentation (4-6 hours at room temperature, or overnight in refrigerator):</strong> Cover dough and let rise slowly. The long fermentation develops complex flavor. Dough should roughly double in size.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Shape (10 minutes):</strong> Turn dough onto lightly floured surface. Shape into a round boule or oval batard. Place seam-side up in a floured banneton basket, or seam-side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Final Rise (2-3 hours, or overnight in refrigerator):</strong> Cover shaped dough. Let rise until puffy and soft to the touch. Cold fermentation overnight intensifies flavor and makes scoring easier.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Prepare for Baking (10 minutes):</strong> Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). If using Dutch oven, preheat that too. Prepare glaze: mix honey with 30ml water until smooth.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Score (2 minutes):</strong> Using a sharp knife or bread lame, score the top of the dough with a single slash or decorative pattern. This controls where the bread expands.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Bake (35-40 minutes):</strong> Place bread in preheated Dutch oven (or on preheated baking stone with steam pan). Bake covered for 20 minutes. Remove lid, brush with honey-water glaze, and bake 15-20 minutes more until deep golden brown.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Cool (1 hour minimum):</strong> Remove from oven and place on wire rack. The bread continues to cook as it cools. Wait at least an hour before slicing to allow the crumb structure to set.</li>

      <h3>✨ Baker's Notes</h3>
      
      <div class="recipe-note">
        <strong>About the Rose Water:</strong> The key to this recipe is restraint. Rose water is powerful—use only ¼ teaspoon. Too much overpowers the bread and tastes floral rather than elegant. The rose should whisper, not shout. It's meant to enhance the natural sweetness of the bread, not mask it.
      </div>

      <div class="recipe-note">
        <strong>Water Temperature Matters:</strong> Use water between 75-80°F (24-27°C) for room temperature fermentation. Cooler water slows fermentation, allowing more flavor development. This is why this recipe calls for slow fermentation—the extended time creates a more complex, nuanced loaf.
      </div>

      <div class="recipe-note">
        <strong>The Honey Glaze:</strong> The honey glaze isn't just decorative. It caramelizes during the final bake, creating a subtle sweetness and beautiful sheen. This nod to love and devotion is what makes rose bread special.
      </div>

      <h3 style="color: var(--accent-gold); margin-top: 20px;">Baking Tips</h3>
      <div class="baking-tips">
        <div class="tip">
          <strong>🌡️ Temperature:</strong> Use a kitchen thermometer. Dough should reach 75°F. This affects fermentation speed.
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
          <strong>⏱️ Timing:</strong> Fermentation times vary with temperature. Trust visual cues over time—dough should look puffy and feel airy.
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
          <strong>🥖 Scoring:</strong> A sharp knife or lame creates clean cuts. This controls oven spring and creates an attractive appearance.
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
          <strong>🌡️ Doneness:</strong> Internal temperature should reach 205-210°F (96-99°C). Tap the bottom—it should sound hollow.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="recipe-note" style="margin-top: 20px;">
        <strong>Yield:</strong> One beautiful 1.5lb (700g) loaf, with a delicate rose aroma, complex flavor, and rustic-beautiful crumb structure.<br><br>
        <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Intermediate. This recipe requires patience and attention, but is achievable for home bakers comfortable with bread fermentation.

Every morning I make this bread, and with each loaf, I connect to a mother I never met, a grandmother I never knew. This recipe is more than instructions. It's a letter written in flour and water, passed from hand to hand across a century. When I smell the rose in the oven, I smell my mother's love."

The recipe bridges the Montrose family (Cordelia) and the Sullivan family (Eleanor's adoptive parents). The specificity of the rose water measurement (¼ teaspoon—'use sparingly, this is precious') appears in Elias Monroe's handwriting in Eleanor's diary.
