        botanical: "This dried flower specimen is from the rare Nightshade family. The preservation method is professional—this is not a casual collection. Someone with botanical expertise has catalogued this carefully.",
        medical: "The symptoms described in these notes match poisoning. The timeline, the physical manifestations, the progression—all consistent with a specific toxin administered over several doses.",
        documents: "These financial records show embezzlement spanning three years. The amounts are substantial. Someone has been systematically draining the estate through falsified entries. This is not accidental.",

        rumors: "This letter mentions someone named 'A.C.' and seems to discuss a disagreement. You gather there was tension, but the exact nature of the conflict remains unclear.",
        botanical: "A preserved plant specimen. It appears to be from a rare variety, though you're not certain which one. Someone cared enough to preserve it carefully.",
        medical: "Medical notes with descriptions of illness. Someone was experiencing serious symptoms that required documentation. The condition seems significant.",
        documents: "Financial records. There appear to be some discrepancies, but you're not trained enough to determine their significance. Numbers don't quite add up.",
        artifacts: "A decorative item that appears to be of some age and quality. You sense it might be valuable, but you're uncertain of its true worth or authenticity."
      },
      limited: {
        rumors: "You sense gossip here—tension between people, whispered conversations. Something caused conflict, but the specifics elude you.",
        botanical: "A pretty preserved flower in a glass case. It's quite beautiful and seems to be part of a collection.",
        medical: "Medical notes. Someone was unwell. The handwriting seems rushed, as if written in distress.",
        documents: "Papers arranged in a file. They seem important to someone. The contents are beyond your immediate understanding.",
        artifacts: "An interesting decorative object. You're not sure what it is exactly, but it seems out of place among other items."
