        <p>SEBASTIAN CRANE, 30, proprietor of Crane's Pharmaceutical Preparations on Ocean Boulevard, was found dead yesterday morning in his laboratory, the victim of acute cardiac failure, according to Dr. Thaddeus Crane, medical examiner. The circumstances surrounding the young man's sudden death have set tongues wagging throughout the city's business district.</p>
        
        <p>Several witnesses report a heated altercation between Mr. Crane and Frankie Romano, the notorious shipping magnate, at the harbor docks not two weeks prior. <span class="quote">"I heard them going at it something fierce," said dock foreman Gerald Hutchins, 52. "Crane was trying to back out of some arrangement, far as I could tell. Romano doesn't take kindly to quitters, if you catch my meaning."</span></p>
        
        <p>Romano's reputation for ruthless business dealings is well-established in maritime circles. <span class="quote">"That Romano fella? He's got fingers in everything," remarked bar proprietor 'Dutch' McKenzie. "You cross him, you disappear. Mark my words."</span></p>
        
        <p>Mr. Crane's involvement in dubious pharmaceutical enterprises has been whispered about in certain quarters for some time. <span class="quote">"Young Sebastian wasn't your ordinary apothecary," confided a source close to the Montrose family, requesting anonymity. "He had connections to the import business—the kind of imports that don't always come through official channels, if you understand."</span></p>
        
        <p>Federal investigators have taken preliminary interest in Mr. Crane's business records, though no charges have been filed. The death has been ruled natural, yet questions linger. Was the young man merely another casualty of the criminal underworld? Or was his demise the result of some darker misadventure? The investigation continues.</p>
